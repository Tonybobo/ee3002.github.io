1
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:11,030
all chips start out with a very simple

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:14,480
raw material sand sand is primarily made

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,490
up of silicon dioxide or silica silicon

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,980
is the second most abundant element in

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:22,909
the Earth's crust but is only ever found

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,829
as a compound with oxygen complex

7
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:27,560
chemical and physical processes are

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,960
required to ensure that silicon crystals

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,859
meets the high production standards that

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,350
apply to chips to convert silica sand to

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,300
silicon the sand is combined with carbon

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,660
and heated to an extremely high

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,100
temperature to remove the oxygen a

14
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,289
number of other steps are required to

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,660
create the finished product namely an

16
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:50,090
extremely pure mono crystalline silicon

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,949
ingot called a bull with only one

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,920
impurity atom for every 10 million

19
00:00:51,949 --> 00:00:56,570
silicon atoms silicon bulls are

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,510
fabricated in a range of different

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:03,469
diameters the most common sizes are 150

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,540
200 and 300 millimeters wafers with

23
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:08,020
large diameters offer more space for

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,020
chips

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,440
extremely thin wafers are then cut from

26
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,470
the silicon bulls using a special sawing

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,090
technique these wafers are the basic

28
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:24,930
building blocks for subsequent chip

29
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:27,490
production silicon is a semiconductor

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,780
this means it can conduct electricity

31
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,200
and also act as an insulator its atomic

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,500
structure looks like this every silicon

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,010
atom has four outer electrons there are

34
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,200
no free charge carriers as a result the

35
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,270
pure mono crystalline silicon is non

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,640
conductive at room temperature to allow

37
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,500
it to become conductive small quantities

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,780
of specific atoms are added as

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,550
impurities to the wafer these impurity

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,010
atoms must have a number of outer

41
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,740
electrons that is either one more or one

42
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,420
less than that of silicon silicon is in

43
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,410
the fourteenth group of the periodic

44
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,000
table of elements

45
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,310
this means that elements in the

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
thirteenth or fifteenth group have to be

47
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,929
used in this process referred to as

48
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,220
doping boron and phosphorus atoms are

49
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,560
the most suitable elements in these

50
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,330
groups they are very close to silicon on

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,090
the periodic table and therefore have

52
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,640
very similar properties phosphorus has

53
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,620
five outer electrons when it is inserted

54
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,300
into the silicon crystal lattice the

55
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:28,269
fifth phosphorus electron can move

56
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,519
freely this means that the silicon

57
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:32,519
phosphorus crystal is n conductive

58
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,160
in contrast boron atoms only have three

59
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,560
outer electrons when they are introduced

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,740
into the silicon lattice one silicon

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,800
electron has nothing to bond to this

62
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,810
creates electron holes the holes move

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,410
through the crystal like positively

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:58,600
charged particles making the material P

65
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:01,330
conductive transistors are built on the

66
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,120
P and n conductive layers that exists in

67
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,780
a doped wafer transistors are the

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,370
smallest control units and microchips

69
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,440
their job is to control electric

70
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,420
voltages and currents and they are by

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,860
far the most important components of

72
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:20,380
electronic circuits every transistor on

73
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,230
a chip contains P and n conductive

74
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,240
layers made of silicon crystals they

75
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,080
also have an additional layer of silicon

76
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,420
oxide which acts as an insulator a layer

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,350
of electrically conductive polysilicon

78
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,170
is applied on top of this every

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,210
transistor has three terminals the

80
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,710
middle one is attached to the gate which

81
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,220
is the electrically conductive

82
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,220
polysilicon

83
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,480
if an electrical charge is applied to

84
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,200
only the two outer terminals electricity

85
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,910
cannot flow as the transistor is blocked

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,230
this changes however if an additional

87
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,760
charge is applied to the middle terminal

88
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,590
electrons from the P layer are then

89
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,840
pulled toward the middle terminal and

90
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,150
accumulate at the area bordering the

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:12,130
silicon crystal and the insulating gate

92
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,260
oxide a channel then forms underneath

93
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,590
the gate between the islands of n

94
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,049
conductive material electrons can now

95
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:24,400
flow through this channel the electrical

96
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:25,990
circuit is closed in this way the

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,710
transistor can be switched back and

98
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:36,070
forth between current enable and disable

99
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:39,280
between zero and one on and off but how

100
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,169
are these layers created on a wafer the

101
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,180
process to manufacture chips from a

102
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,600
wafer starts with the layout and design

103
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,430
phase highly complex chips are made up

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,070
of billions of integrated and connected

105
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,380
transistors enabling sophisticated

106
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,300
circuits such as microcontrollers and

107
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,880
crypto chips to be built on a

108
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,180
semiconductor surface measuring just a

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,160
few square millimeters in size the sheer

110
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,700
number of components calls for an

111
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:09,490
in-depth design process this entails

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,280
defining the chips functions simulating

113
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,870
its technical and physical properties

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,430
testing its functionality and working

115
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,550
out the individual transistor

116
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,979
connections special design tools are

117
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,380
used to draw up the plans for integrated

118
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,710
circuits and develop a three-dimensional

119
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,620
architecture of sandwich layers

120
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:33,940
this blueprint is transferred to photo

121
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,370
masks providing geometric images of the

122
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,500
circuits the photo masks are used as

123
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:43,360
image templates during the subsequent

124
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:45,639
chip fabrication process to ensure that

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,070
the microscopic structures of a chip are

126
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,740
reproduced flawlessly they have to be

127
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,270
fabricated in a dust-free environment

128
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,090
with stable temperature and humidity

129
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,860
levels in other words they have to be

130
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:02,020
made in a cleanroom a cleanroom is a

131
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,289
room in which no more than one particle

132
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,770
of dust larger than 0.5 micrometers is

133
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,330
permitted in around 10 litres of air

134
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,130
this is even cleaner than the air in an

135
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,110
operating room

136
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,310
the ventilation filtration and supply

137
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,139
systems in a cleanroom

138
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,930
therefore have to be extremely

139
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,060
sophisticated several million cubic

140
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,610
meters of air are circulated every hour

141
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:28,240
and hundreds of air volume regulators

142
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,190
maintain a constant air flow employees

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
in these production areas have to abide

144
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,599
by an extremely strict dress code they

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,020
are not permitted to smoke before work

146
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,669
or wear any makeup or jewelry cleanroom

147
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,990
production areas can only be accessed

148
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:46,510
through a special airlock chips are

149
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,080
built on a base wafer cut from a silicon

150
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,150
pool depending on their size several

151
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,770
dozen or several thousand chips can be

152
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:59,229
fabricated on one wafer first of all the

153
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,479
surface of the wafer is oxidized in a

154
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,330
high-temperature furnace operating at

155
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,210
approximately 1,000 degrees Celsius to

156
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,520
create a non conductive layer then a

157
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,530
photoresist material is uniformly

158
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,560
distributed on this non conductive layer

159
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:18,720
using centrifugal force this coating

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,720
process creates a light-sensitive layer

161
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,930
the wafer is then exposed to light

162
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,860
through the photo mask in special

163
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,230
exposure machines known as steppers

164
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,120
during this process coaster sized areas

165
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,790
of the chip template known as recta

166
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,800
khals are used to transfer the complex

167
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:39,520
geometric patterns of the circuit design

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,800
to the silicon wafer the exposed area of

169
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,350
the chip pattern is developed revealing

170
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,750
the layer of oxide below the unexposed

171
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:51,490
part remains as is protecting the layer

172
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:53,650
of oxide after this the exposed layer of

173
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,140
oxide is etched off in the areas that

174
00:07:53,650 --> 00:08:01,390
have been developed using wet or plasma

175
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:03,490
etching with plasma etching special

176
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:07,120
gases bond with the substrate to be

177
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,550
removed in the reaction chamber this

178
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,770
enables microscopic layers to be removed

179
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:17,680
in the windows that were exposed and

180
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:19,510
developed in the previous step once the

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,030
photoresist residue has been stripped

182
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:25,570
and the wafer has been cleaned the wafer

183
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,060
undergoes further oxidation electrically

184
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:32,410
conductive polysilicon is deposited on

185
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:34,330
this insulation layer then photoresist

186
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,520
is applied again and the wafer is

187
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,760
exposed to light through the mask the

188
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:42,010
exposed photoresist is stripped again

189
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,410
now the polysilicon and the thin oxide

190
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,720
layer are etched off these two layers

191
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,150
only remain intact in the centre under

192
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,700
the photoresist the next step is the

193
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,270
doping process where impurity atoms are

194
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,550
introduced into the exposed silicon and

195
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,610
ion implanter is used to shoot impurity

196
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:03,010
atoms into the silicon this changes the

197
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,390
conductivity of the exposed silicon by

198
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,390
fractions of a micrometer

199
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,450
after the photoresist residue has been

200
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,270
stripped

201
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,220
another oxide layer is applied the wafer

202
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,620
undergoes another cycle of applying

203
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,530
photoresist exposure through the mask

204
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,570
and stripping contact holes are etched

205
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,760
to provide access to the conductive

206
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,740
layers enabling the contacts and

207
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,400
interconnections to be integrated in the

208
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,620
wafer this is done by depositing metal

209
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,480
alloys onto the wafer in sputtering

210
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,980
machines

211
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,990
[Music]

212
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,750
once again the photoresist and masks are

213
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,600
applied the unexposed strips remain as

214
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,190
is after the etching process providing a

215
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,710
point of contact to the underlying

216
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,810
layers to give the insulation layer

217
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,600
above the interconnections the smooth

218
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:57,030
finish it requires a chemical mechanical

219
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:05,610
process is used to polish away excess

220
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:07,470
material with micrometer accuracy these

221
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,180
individual steps may be repeated

222
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,820
multiple times in the fabrication

223
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,290
process until the integrated circuit is

224
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:18,570
complete depending on the size and type

225
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,090
of chip the wafer will now contain

226
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,870
anything from several dozen to thousands

227
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:27,720
of chips individual chips are usually

228
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,520
sought out of the wafer the chips are

229
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,740
not lined up flush with each other on

230
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,540
the wafer because tiny parts of the

231
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,990
wafer splinter off during the sawing

232
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,450
process a certain amount of space known

233
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,810
as the scribe line is always left

234
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:44,700
between the individual chips test

235
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,010
structures are also integrated in the

236
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,720
space between the chips and used to take

237
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,540
measurements immediately after

238
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,190
production these tech structures are

239
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,190
destroyed during the sawing process

240
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,560
the size of the resulting chips

241
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,850
typically varies between one square

242
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,560
millimeter and a few square centimeters

243
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,259
the final stage of fabrication is

244
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,060
assembly here the individual chips are

245
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,329
placed in a package and terminals are

246
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,519
attached the result is a finished

247
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,110
semiconductor device which can be

248
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,000
mounted on circuit boards using

249
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,800
different types of terminals over a

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,949
thousand connection contacts can be

251
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,180
realized here are some examples of ready

252
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:30,949
packaged semiconductor components

253
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,290
special larger packages are used for

254
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,720
power semiconductors intended for

255
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,529
applications such as trains electric

256
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,269
cars solar panels and wind turbines

257
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:43,490
these power semiconductors are designed

258
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,680
to switch electrical currents of up to

259
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:51,050
several hundred amps and voltages that

260
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,970
run into the thousands switching at this

261
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,399
level generates high temperatures and

262
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,440
this heat has to be dissipated via

263
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:01,940
cooling areas integrated into the

264
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:05,829
packages here you can see some fully

265
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,829

271
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,530
microscopes to repeatedly check the

272
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,600
chips at different points in the

273
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,780
production process

274
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,270
if we compare today's micro electronics

275
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,180
