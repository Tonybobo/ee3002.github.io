1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:11,870
so in this video I'm going to be talking

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:13,620
about the MOSFET IV characteristics and

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,690
specifically I'm going to be talking

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,060
about what's called the long channel

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:23,189
model and what that means will hopefully

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,380
be clear in a second so I'm assuming

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,269
that you've you're taking a

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,170
semiconductor physics course and you

9
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:39,260
encountered this equation IDs equals mu

10
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:45,570
n si ox W over L times vgs minus VT

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:48,480
times VDS minus one-half VDS squared and

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,789
you're just thrown the equation were

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,640
just thrown at you maybe very briefly

14
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,260
they went over where it came from but

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,120
essentially they just throw it at you

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,800
and expect you to memorize it in this

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,800
video I'm gonna try to go over where

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,619
exactly this equation comes from and so

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:09,570
this is also known as MOSFET operating

20
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:12,240
in the triode region and so I'm gonna

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,920
try to describe the model behind where

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,100
this equation comes from and how we

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,500
actually arrive at it so it turns out

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,439
that the model is actually pretty scheme

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,310
pretty simple actually a scarily simple so

26
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,860
if we've got to say we've got a MOSFET

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,850
right here so this is going to be our

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:41,640
gate we've got some gates got some

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:43,979
thickness here so it's got some metal up

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,470
top probably copper or aluminum or

31
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,299
polysilicon let's just say it's a little

32
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,470
numb or something then we've got an

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,200
oxide which essentially protects the

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,030
gate or protects the rest of the MOSFET

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:05,270
from the gate and we've got our P

36
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:07,649
substrate our n + Wells this is a n Moss

37
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,379
MOSFET and so I'm assuming that you've

38
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,390
seen all this before and so the model

39
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,710
that we're going to use is basically

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,390
we're going to ignore

41
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,810
all the complicated stuff and just

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,380
pretend that we only care about this

43
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,000
region here the channel and specifically

44
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,010
we're assuming that the channel is just

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,280
comprised of a bunch of charges and here

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,720
they're assumes to be actually negative

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,200
charges because this is an NMOS

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:42,780
transistor so we've got a bunch of

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,590
negative charges piling up here and

50
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,440
we're interested in the current from the

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,810
source to the drain so we're interested

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,550
or typically we're interested in the

53
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,820
current from the drain to the source or

54
00:02:53,550 --> 00:03:00,810
the electron flow from the source to the

55
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:04,170
drain IDs so we want an equation for

56
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,570
ideas we want IDs equals what what does

57
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,950
it depend on and I've already told you

58
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,230
the answer up here but how do we

59
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,890
actually get to that answer and how can

60
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:17,070
we remember that answer well we know

61
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:20,820
that a MOSFET behaves like a variable

62
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:23,690
capacitor right so if we've got a if we

63
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:25,940
apply a certain voltage to the gate

64
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,200
nothing happens

65
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,150
we're increasing the voltage nothing

66
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,440
happens nothing happens and then all of

67
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,230
a sudden we'll start to get these

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,360
carriers accumulate near the edge at a

69
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:44,400
certain threshold voltage so at VG and

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:47,580
we'll just say VG C because this is the

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,070
voltage relative to the channel or the

72
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,190
little portion of the substrate that we

73
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,440
care about so at VGC equals the

74
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:03,540
threshold voltage we start getting

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:05,340
charge accumulation at the interface so

76
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,670
we start getting negative charges piling

77
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,650
up here and positive charges piling up

78
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,180
on the gate now as we increase the

79
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,870
voltage on the gate there are always

80
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,720
charges piling up on the gate but the

81
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,500
p-type substrate has too many positive

82
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,419
charges such that the channel doesn't

83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,070
actually look like it has any negative

84
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,400
charge so we have to overcome that

85
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:32,950
first so this is all that we're going to

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,740
use to derive this model we're gonna

87
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,950
assume that this MOSFET acts like a

88
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,420
capacitor and we know that the charge of

89
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,730
a capacitor is just equal to the

90
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,350
capacitance times the voltage except in

91
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,390
our case it takes a certain voltage

92
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,030
before the MOSFET starts acting like a

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,650
capacitor so we're gonna change this a

94
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,630
little bit we're gonna say that Q is

95
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:56,020
equal to the capacitance times some

96
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:58,570
voltage minus the threshold voltage and

97
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,510
so this is the equation that we're we're

98
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,100
going to start with well we're not

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,040
actually interested in the charge we're

100
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,690
interested in the current and how did

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,090
how do we relate the - well we know if

102
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:15,400
we've got say we've got a cube of charge

103
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:19,060
here and it's got some value Q we know

104
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:22,150
that the current so the current flowing

105
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,830
through some plane here the charge block

106
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,340
is just moving along minding its own

107
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,670
business

108
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,970
the current is just how long it takes

109
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,880
this block of charge to move through

110
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:38,020
this plane so it's the total charge

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,740
divided by the time that it takes and so

112
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,730
up until the charge block reaches the

113
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,110
reaches the plane we don't have any

114
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,300
current and then all of a sudden we

115
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,400
start having current as the as the

116
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,750
charge block transitions through the

117
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,990
through the plane well okay what is what

118
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,550
is the time it takes a charge block to

119
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:01,060
transition through the through the plane

120
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,810
well we know the the charge block has a

121
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,870
certain length to it right so and it's

122
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:11,170
got a certain velocity V so the time

123
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,660
that it takes is just the length divided

124
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,030
by the velocity well that's that's

125
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,700
fairly simple right so we can rearrange

126
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,340
our or plug that into our equation we

127
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,180
say that I is equal to Q or the total

128
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:30,760
charge of our block divided by L over V

129
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,440
or Q divided by L times V and V here is

130
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,570
the velocity so why don't we call this

131
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,100
like EQ of the velocity of the charge

132
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:40,310
block Q

133
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,280
well okay so from this from this where

134
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,060
do we go well if we want to know the

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,580
charge of a capacitor recall that we've

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,930
got a capacitor here we know that the

137
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:59,140
charge is just CV or as we said above C

138
00:06:53,930 --> 00:07:01,730
V minus vthreshold so we can add that in

139
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:05,060
we've got the capacitance V minus

140
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:10,040
vthreshold divided by the length times

141
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,750
the velocity of the charge block and if

142
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,050
you've taken semiconductor physics

143
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:17,420
you'll know that Ohm's law on the

144
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,480
microscopic level just says that the

145
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:23,050
velocity of a given charge charged

146
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,880
particle is just equal to the mobility

147
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:30,020
times of that charged particle times the

148
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,460
electric field so we can replace that in

149
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:36,230
our equation we're starting to get

150
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:40,100
Chardonnay closer and I'm going to

151
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,780
replace this V with V G C the voltage

152
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,340
between the gate and the channel just so

153
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,680
it's clear what voltage we're talking

154
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,860
about and the reason I'm replacing this

155
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,920
V velocity as quickly as I can and so we

156
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,040
don't have multiple V's floating around

157
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,770
so that's equal to C VG minus VT times

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,210
the mobility times the electric field

159
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:03,680
divided by the length well okay you can

160
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,210
probably guess what we're gonna do next

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,970
we're gonna use another elementary

162
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,400
formula to figure out the rest of these

163
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,920
things so what is the capacitance what

164
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,840
is the electric field now we're assuming

165
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,640
that we know the mobility we're assuming

166
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,900
that we know the dimensions of this

167
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:24,260
thing so that those are the those the

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,270
only assumptions that we make well onto

169
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,590
capacitance so we know that the

170
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,040
capacitance of a parallel plate

171
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:35,180
capacitor that's filled with some

172
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:37,849
dielectric of permittivity epsilon we

173
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,450
know that the capacitance is just the

174
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,160
area times that epsilon divided by the

175
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,240
thickness or the distance between the

176
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,980
two plates here we call this t ox or the

177
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,860
thickness of the oxide because that's

178
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,990
the thickness of

179
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,570
capacitance or the dielectric that were

180
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,370
that were interested in and area we can

181
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,190
just rewrite as the width of the

182
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:05,420
transistor times the length of the

183
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,100
transistor so W times L times epsilon

184
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:11,209
divided by the thickness of the oxide

185
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:14,149
and so that's we just plug that back

186
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,730
into the equation so W times L times

187
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,399
epsilon divided by thickness of the

188
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,209
oxide and then we've got another L on

189
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:29,620
the bottom and then that's multiplied by

190
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:32,089
mu e times VG e or VG C minus VT and

191
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,310
sorry if the equation is starting to get

192
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:36,470
a little a little complicated we're

193
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,870
going to simplify it right now so first

194
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,490
these ELLs are going to cancel out and

195
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:47,569
we're going to group these these terms t

196
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:51,319
ox and epsilon into a single term C ox

197
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:53,329
or the in other words we're going to say

198
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:56,089
that the total capacitance is equal to C

199
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:59,990
ox times the area of the transistor or

200
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,579
the so C ox is a capacitance density if

201
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,750
you will it's the capacitance per unit

202
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:08,300
area of the device so if we cancel out L

203
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:16,010
we make that substitution we get our

204
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:19,459
formula W times C ox times mu e times V

205
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:22,149
G C minus VT and we're starting to get

206
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:26,149
closer see we've got a W we've got a mu

207
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:28,130
we've got a C ox we we still have this e

208
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:30,589
which we will want to get rid of and

209
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,560
we've got this awkward VGC because we we

210
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,300
don't know what VC is we don't the

211
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,510
channel isn't a terminal of the

212
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,760
transistor so let's let's see what else

213
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,130
we can do to this equation

214
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,860
well how about let's just attack this

215
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:49,399
first one e so what is the electric

216
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:51,290
field in the in the channel in terms of

217
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,370
what we know well if we go back to our

218
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:58,579
transistor we know that there's a source

219
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,410
on this side there's a drain on this

220
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:02,510
side or we can flip the sides if you

221
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,019
prefer and there's some voltage between

222
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,019
the two

223
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,720
VDS and we know just from basic

224
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:15,259
electromagnetics that the electric field

225
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,360
between two points in space if

226
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:20,000
everything is homogeneous and everything

227
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,759
works out everything works out nicely is

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,209
just equal to the voltage divided by the

229
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,069
distance between them which here is the

230
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,839
transistor length so we're assuming that

231
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,839
these wells are all at the same

232
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,079
potential well okay we can we can make

233
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:40,519
that substitution and then we get mu

234
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:43,069
times C ox times W and now we have the

235
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,000
over L that we were expecting which is

236
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:51,290
from our electric field times VD s times

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,970
VGC minus VT and we're almost done the

238
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:59,930
the only thing left is VG C so how do we

239
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:04,990
how do we figure out what VG c is well

240
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:08,600
if we look at our MOSFET again this is

241
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:11,990
VC so we've got a we've got a certain

242
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,620
gate voltage that we apply right VG and

243
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:18,649
we've got a channel voltage here VC and

244
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,660
then we also know there's a source

245
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:23,750
voltage here V s and a drain voltage

246
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,839
here V D and you know if we just make

247
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,660
some some somewhat sketchy arguments

248
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,449
like say pretend there's two resistors

249
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,779
here and there's some current flowing

250
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:38,029
through this eye then we know that VC is

251
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:39,920
and let's say these resistors are the

252
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,410
same value and this is you know fairly

253
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,560
realistic because the material itself is

254
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,449
going to have a resistance so we we know

255
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,300
that this point VC has to be the

256
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:55,730
midpoint between V s and VD that's just

257
00:12:50,300 --> 00:13:01,699
a basic voltage divider so we can

258
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:06,079
rewrite VC VC is just V s plus VD over

259
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:08,449
du or it's the midpoint and now we just

260
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,480
need to perform some algebraic wizardry

261
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:14,000
which all all that ever amounts to in

262
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,459
engineering is subtracting or adding one

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,630
or subtracting or adding a zero from an

264
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,700
equation so

265
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,330
we're gonna say VC is equal to vs over

266
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,270
two plus VD over two and then we're

267
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,830
going to add zero and the reason we're

268
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,290
gonna add zero is so we can rearrange

269
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:33,380
this equation make it nice and pretty

270
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:35,860
we're going to add V s over 2 minus 3 s

271
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,860
over 2

272
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:43,760
ok so rewriting the full equation this

273
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:49,610
is this is going to be our almost our

274
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:53,450
final form IDs is equal to MU n and this

275
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:58,250
so this is mu of the electrons see ox W

276
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:03,800
over L times when we had a VD s and then

277
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:08,630
VG C which is VG minus VC which is V s

278
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:14,270
over 2 plus V s over 2 that's BS VD over

279
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:21,080
2 so plus VD over 2 and then there was

280
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:23,120
another minus V s over 2 and then minus

281
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,380
the threshold voltage VT I might have

282
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,840
forgotten that up there as well okay so

283
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,590
all we need to do is group things and

284
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:38,600
rearrange them so mu n SI ox W over L

285
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:42,980
times VD s times VG minus V s which is

286
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:47,480
just VG s plus one half and now we're

287
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:52,370
going to group this VD and this V s plus

288
00:14:47,480 --> 00:15:00,740
1/2 V SD or we can rewrite that as minus

289
00:14:52,370 --> 00:15:03,530
1/2 VD s minus 1/2 VD s minus VT and

290
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,050
then all we need to do is factor this VD

291
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:08,570
s into all these terms and we're done

292
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,450
and we have our final equation for a

293
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:18,620
MOSFET which is the drain current mu n

294
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:25,430
si ox W over L times vgs minus VT times

295
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:27,290
VDS minus 1/2 VDS squared and so that's

296
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,330
sort of where the equation comes from

297
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,580
that's the that's the derivation for it

298
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,860
I hope you found this video interesting

299
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,270
and hopefully not too mathematical and

300
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,670
we're kind of able to follow along with

301
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,730
what we're doing I strongly suggest that

302
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,680
you you try to do this yourself because

303
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,050
the thinking process behind it is the

304
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,540
same thinking process behind basically

305
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,690
all of engineering so hope you enjoyed

306
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,690
