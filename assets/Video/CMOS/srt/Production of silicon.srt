0:00:05.180,0:00:10.490
silicon is a semiconductor and its main
applications fall into three categories

0:00:10.490,0:00:16.410
first solar cells and components in
electronics like for example your mobile

0:00:16.410,0:00:21.720
telephone and your computer in this
group one utilizes the semiconducting

0:00:21.720,0:00:28.320
properties of silicon the next category
is aluminium alloys silicon is added as

0:00:28.320,0:00:33.690
an alloying element to aluminium to
enhance the properties of the alloy the

0:00:33.690,0:00:39.420
last category is the increasing use of
silicon to produce silicones silicones

0:00:39.420,0:00:44.929
have numerous uses from baking products
to stickers

0:00:45.219,0:00:52.539
the Earth's crust comprises 28% silicon
and 47% oxygen by weight there is a

0:00:52.539,0:00:57.339
large abundance of silicon and the
Earth's crust consists mainly of oxides

0:00:57.339,0:01:03.940
such as silicon dioxide if one wants to
produce elemental silicon one needs

0:01:03.940,0:01:08.920
however quite pure silicon dioxide
sources and hence most producers of

0:01:08.920,0:01:14.649
silicon import silicon dioxide the
silicon produced directly from silicon

0:01:14.649,0:01:19.720
dioxide is known as metallurgical grade
silicon and the pure silicon dioxide

0:01:19.720,0:01:26.500
material is called quartz to produce
metallurgical grade silicon one needs

0:01:26.500,0:01:31.659
quartz the raw material that contains
silicon and coal to remove the oxygen

0:01:31.659,0:01:36.159
from the quartz and wood chips to
maintain good permeability in the

0:01:36.159,0:01:42.330
furnace for the gas to escape
silicon is produced in large industrial

0:01:42.330,0:01:48.090
furnaces the production process requires
large amounts of energy 10 to 12

0:01:48.090,0:01:52.409
megawatt hours of the ton of silicon
produce as well as utilizing high

0:01:52.409,0:01:58.890
temperatures up to 2,000 degrees C and
the lower part of the fence the electric

0:01:58.890,0:02:03.240
energy is supplied by a three large
carbon electrodes that are submerged

0:02:03.240,0:02:08.580
into the raw materials the electrodes
will gradually be consumed and therefore

0:02:08.580,0:02:12.780
new electrode elements are added by
screwing them to the top of the furnace

0:02:12.780,0:02:18.780
electrodes the quartz carbon and wood
chips are added from silos at the top of

0:02:18.780,0:02:23.760
the furnace as the materials are
conveyed through the furnace the oxygen

0:02:23.760,0:02:28.380
is removed from the quartz and liquid
silicon is tapped from the lower part of

0:02:28.380,0:02:34.110
the furnace at high temperatures the
liquid silicon is tapped into laters

0:02:34.110,0:02:38.590
where small parts of aluminium and
calcium are reduced

0:02:38.590,0:02:45.849
after this refining process the liquid
silicon is cast into beds to solidify

0:02:45.849,0:02:54.069
the solidified silicon is then crushed
and shipped to the customer

0:02:54.510,0:03:00.090
the simplified equation of the silicon
production process shows silicon dioxide

0:03:00.090,0:03:05.020
reacting with carbon to produce silicon
which will be tapped from the furnace

0:03:05.020,0:03:10.080
and carbon monoxide gas that will ascend
through the materials in the furnace

0:03:10.080,0:03:15.600
there are however two important species
that will also be present in the furnace

0:03:15.600,0:03:23.110
silicon carbide and silicon monoxide gas
if we focus on the area around one of

0:03:23.110,0:03:27.970
the electrodes we can see the major
zones in a furnace in the lower part of

0:03:27.970,0:03:32.260
the furnace the temperature is about
2,000 degrees C with the energy being

0:03:32.260,0:03:36.610
produced by the arcs from the electrode
to the liquid silicon at the bottom of

0:03:36.610,0:03:42.040
the furnace or to the silicon carbide
crust that has formed in the arc itself

0:03:42.040,0:03:46.870
the temperature is much higher the arc
is produced because there is a cavity

0:03:46.870,0:03:51.250
around the electrode tip which is filled
with silicon monoxide and carbon

0:03:51.250,0:03:58.030
monoxide gas as one goes up the furnace
the temperature decreases and a mixture

0:03:58.030,0:04:03.670
of melted silicon dioxide and silicon
carbide is over the cavity Bickford

0:04:03.670,0:04:09.280
silicon is very viscous and the material
mix will not flow down naturally as a

0:04:09.280,0:04:16.000
result the cavity roof is formed this is
a very simplified picture and during

0:04:16.000,0:04:20.160
industrial excavations many different
zones and geometries have been found

0:04:20.160,0:04:25.720
however the common picture is the
presence of the cavity alpha silicon

0:04:25.720,0:04:30.140
carbide built up in the burner
and parley transformed broad materials

0:04:30.140,0:04:35.300
in the top part of the furnace the
temperature on top of the raw materials

0:04:35.300,0:04:42.320
is approximately 1,000 degrees C the
most important reaction in the so-called

0:04:42.320,0:04:47.870
low temperature zone is the reaction
between carbon and the ascending silicon

0:04:47.870,0:04:53.980
dioxide gas as a production of silicon
monoxide gas consumes a lot of energy

0:04:53.980,0:04:58.370
the energy consumption will have a
strong correlation with the silicon

0:04:58.370,0:05:04.490
monoxide lost out of the thirst the main
role of the carbon added will hence be

0:05:04.490,0:05:12.800
to capture the silicon dioxide gas
before it leaves the furnace

0:05:18.539,0:05:23.650
the brown condensate will agglomerate
the quartz the silicon carbide particles

0:05:23.650,0:05:29.680
are shown in the picture micrographs of
this brown condensate shows that this

0:05:29.680,0:05:34.570
silicon embedded in a silicon dioxide
nature

0:05:34.570,0:05:38.950
when this condensate is heated as it
descends with the raw materials the

0:05:38.950,0:05:43.630
silicon will accumulate into larger
silicon drops and then finally at high

0:05:43.630,0:05:48.040
enough temperatures where both silicon
dioxide and silicon is melted the

0:05:48.040,0:05:53.350
silicon will flow out of the silicon
dioxide matrix as the condensates

0:05:53.350,0:05:57.880
prevent the materials done down in the
furnace the materials are mechanically

0:05:57.880,0:06:04.990
pushed down with a stoking machine some
silicon can also be produced in the

0:06:04.990,0:06:09.970
silicon carbide particles higher up in
the furnace according to the reaction as

0:06:09.970,0:06:17.020
shown in my craft from a pilot scale
furnace experiment as the carbon

0:06:17.020,0:06:22.000
monoxide the remaining silicon monoxide
gas are leaving the furnace they will

0:06:22.000,0:06:26.950
combine with air at the top of the face
the carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide

0:06:26.950,0:06:33.550
gases will oxidize into carbon dioxide
gas and silicon dioxide micro particles

0:06:33.550,0:06:39.800
called micro silica
micro silica is an important by-product

0:06:39.800,0:06:46.460
and is typically used as filler in
concrete and to produce refractories to

0:06:46.460,0:06:50.570
summarize the metallurgical silicon
production the raw materials added to

0:06:50.570,0:06:56.900
the furnace are silicon dioxide and
carbon materials wood chips are added to

0:06:56.900,0:07:01.520
increase the permeability of the
materials to facilitate gas flow the

0:07:01.520,0:07:05.720
materials are added to the furnace
at approximately 1,000 degrees C and

0:07:05.720,0:07:12.020
will be gradually heated to 2,000
degrees C the liquid silicon will be

0:07:12.020,0:07:16.520
tapped at the lower part of the furnace
into ladles where the trace elements of

0:07:16.520,0:07:21.890
aluminium and calcium will be further
reduce the liquid silicon will then be

0:07:21.890,0:07:28.460
cast solidified crushed and shipped to
customers the micro silica will be

0:07:28.460,0:07:33.170
separated from the off gas in filter
bags and the remaining hot off gas may

0:07:33.170,0:07:40.370
be processed via an energy recovery unit
to produce electrical energy as Norway

0:07:40.370,0:07:45.260
has a large amount of renewable
electrical energy from hydropower there

0:07:45.260,0:07:53.260
are several plants producing silicon and
ferrosilicon like L chem Warka and fin
