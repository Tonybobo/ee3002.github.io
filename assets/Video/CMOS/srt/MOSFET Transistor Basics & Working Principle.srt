1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,529
let us discuss MOSFET in detail

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:16,619
MOSFET is an electronic device most

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,919
widely used in ICs it has three

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,919
terminals named as source drain and gate

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,119
construction of basic design of MOSFET

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,570
is quite simple just take a block of

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,470
p-type semiconductor this block will be

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:42,309
your base for MOSFET we also call it as

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:46,239
substrate and the entire MOSFET we will

10
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:48,250
fabricate on this base now two portions

11
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,250
on the same side of this p-type

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,430
substrate are made highly doped with

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:58,120
n-type impurity as these are shown here

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,160
in the figure source and drain terminals

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,510
are brought out from these two end

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,510
regions as shown

17
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,820
now the entire surface of the substrate

18
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:16,200
is coated with a layer of silicon

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:19,920
dioxide silicon dioxide will behave here

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,450
as insulation on this layer of silicon

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,580
dioxide a thin metallic plate is placed

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:29,850
this metallic plate will act as gauge

23
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,860
contact to the substrate the gate

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,990
terminal is brought out from this

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,670
metallic plate

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,429
hence it is seen from the figure that

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,700
gate contact is insulated from the

28
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:44,070
substrate but drain and source contacts

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,720
are directly connected to respective

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,110
n-type regions

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,200
this was the constructional feature of a

32
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,300
buzz FET now we will come to the

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,300
operational features of MOSFET

34
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,329
for that we have to connect on DC

35
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:06,929
voltage source between these two n-type

36
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:06,929
regions

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,060
you

38
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,260
the n-type region connected with

39
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,530
positive terminal of the source is

40
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,690
called as drain and the N region

41
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,950
connected with negative terminal of the

42
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,840
source is called as source as soon as

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,590
the drain and source are connected with

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,890
DC voltage source there will be two PN

45
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:47,560
junctions formed one is in between

46
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,560
n-type drain and p-type base

47
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:56,310
and the other is in between P type base

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:59,069
and n type source as drain is connected

49
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,620
with positive terminal of the source the

50
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:05,280
drain is in higher voltage than base

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:09,270
hence this PN Junction is reverse biased

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,540
on the other hand as source is connected

53
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,030
with negative terminal of the battery P

54
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,860
type base will be at higher potential

55
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,580
than n type source

56
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:24,989
hence this PN Junction is forward biased

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:28,110
as between drain and source there will

58
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,959
be one reverse biased and one forward

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,150
biased Junction there will be no

60
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,390
significant current flowing from the

61
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,510
drain to source but a tiny current

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:43,080
continues to flow due to minority

63
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:45,840
carriers we can say that virtually there

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,100
is no continuous path or channel between

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,100
drain and source

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,379
now let us see what happens if one

67
00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:01,000
suitable positive voltage is applied at

68
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,000
gate terminal of the device

69
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,860
in that case due to attraction a

70
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:11,080
positive potential of gate contact plate

71
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:14,790
negative free electrons that is minority

72
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,790
carriers in p-type base

73
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:26,350
we'll be accumulated towards a contact

74
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,820
plate and form a channel of negative

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:32,820
charge carriers even inside p-type

76
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
semiconductor

77
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,810
this channel due to higher concentration

78
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,960
of free electrons will behave as n-type

79
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,259
semiconductor

80
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:56,599
although entire base is doped with P

81
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:58,819
type or trivalent impurity it is obvious

82
00:04:56,599 --> 00:05:01,870
that the number of free electrons

83
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,340
accumulated towards gate contact plate

84
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,830
depends on the strength a positive

85
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,969
potential given to the gate terminal

86
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:14,599
hence width of n channel depends on the

87
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:17,659
voltage applied at gate terminal more

88
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:19,969
the applied voltage greater the width of

89
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:22,810
the channel means greater the

90
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:25,370
conductance between drain and source

91
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,650
here we have seen that there is no

92
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,379
direct connection between gauge contact

93
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,139
and substrate instead these are

94
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:36,289
insulated from each other but due to

95
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,330
electrostatic attraction the conducting

96
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:41,210
channel between drain and source is

97
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,599
formed and because of that the channel

98
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,539
is also called induced shadow and the

99
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:51,469
device is called induced channel MOSFET

100
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,330
it is also clear that when there is no

101
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:56,120
voltage applied to the gate of the

102
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,449
device there will be no current from

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,300
drain to source except negligible amount

104
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:06,800
of saturation current due to minority

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,620
carriers but if the gate voltage is

106
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,439
gradually increased by keeping fixed

107
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,469
drain to source voltage after certain

108
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:19,000
minimum applied gate voltage drain to

109
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:19,000
source current will start flowing

110
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,510
and this voltage is called threshold

111
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,510
voltage

112
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,280
so below threshold voltage the device

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,640
will behave as non conducting or in off

114
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,640
board

115
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,819
and for gate voltage greater than

116
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:53,830
threshold value the device will be in

117
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,830
conducting or on mode

118
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:03,370
so this type of MOSFET is suitably used

119
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,370
as a gate control switching device

120
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,030
thank you
