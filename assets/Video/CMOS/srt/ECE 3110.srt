00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,280
in this note we're going to talk about the

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,969
voltages that define different Mosfet

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,969
regions of operation

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,500
we'll start with an N mos device

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,070
we have the cutoff region

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,540
that is defined as the gate-to-source

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:49,560
voltage being less than the threshold

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,700
voltage for the device if the gate to

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,460
source voltage is less than the

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,460
threshold device we are operating in cutoff

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,560
for gate to source voltage greater than

13
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:11,070
the threshold voltage we have to check to

14
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,990
see if

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,180
the gate to source voltage minus the

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,410
threshold if the drain to source voltage

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,550
is greater than the gate to source

18
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:25,170
voltage minus the threshold so the

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:29,580
drain to source is greater than the gate

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:33,500
to source minus at threshold voltage the

21
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,500
device is in saturation

22
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:46,049
if the drain to source is less than the

23
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:46,049
gate to source

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:56,549
minus the threshold voltage the devices in

25
00:01:49,830 --> 00:02:00,409
the triode or linear region now one

26
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,409
thing that we can do is know

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,200
the VDS

28
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,200
minus  VGS

29
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,830
must be greater than minus Vt

30
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,830
or if we multiply everything through by

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:29,540
a negative then we could write that the

32
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,540
VGS minus VDS is

33
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,920
 must be less than VT

34
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,280
because the source is common to both vgs

35
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:47,390
and VDS we could also just write the Vgd

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:51,460
must be less than threshold voltage this

37
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,460
is the case and we're in saturation

38
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:04,720
otherwise

39
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,720
we are in triode/linear

40
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,360
when dealing with a p-mos device the

41
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,610
easiest thing to do is just reverse the

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,250
voltages on all these devices so for

43
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:20,790
instance we could write it for cut

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:25,650
off VSG

45
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:32,489
is less than absolute value of VT for a

46
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:38,549
P-mos device if the VSG is greater

47
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:40,019
than VT for P mos device then we need

48
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,349
to check the drain to source condition

49
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:48,180
so we could write VSD must be greater

50
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:52,590
than the VSG minus the absolute value of

51
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,220
the threshold voltage in this case we're

52
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,220
in saturation

53
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:05,400
if VSD is less than the VSG minus the absolute

54
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,849
value of the threshold voltage in the

55
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,849
device is in the triode or linear region

56
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:29,169
one other note we mentioned that the

57
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,270
channel capacitance is equal to Cox

58
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:35,330
times the width of the device times the

59
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,919
length I wanted it to be clear what we

60
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:44,330
meant by width and length so the length is

61
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,930
the length between the source

62
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,930
terminal

63
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:54,900
separated by the gate of the transistor

64
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:58,500
so this dimension is the length but width

65
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,449
is imagine if we sketch this device into

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,449
three dimensions the width is

67
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,270
that third dimension

68
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:16,400
now we also noted that Cox is equal

69
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:19,460
to eox / tox and this is the

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,620
capacitance per unit area for a device t

71
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,620
ox is the thickness of the oxide

72
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,580
and Eox is equal to

73
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:35,360
the permeability of free space times the

74
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,099
relativev permittivity of

75
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,939
the material in this case silicon

76
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:43,219
dioxide and our relative permittivity

77
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:46,789
for our permittivity of free space is

78
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:52,159
equal to 8.854 times ten to the minus

79
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:55,399
twelve farads per meter and the relative

80
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:58,959
permittivity of silicon dioxide is

81
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,959
approximately equal to four

82
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:02,939
so with all of those equations you

83
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:06,899
should now be able to solve for any Mos

84
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:09,229
device bias region
