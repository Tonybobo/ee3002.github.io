1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,259
in this video we are going to say

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,410
channel length modulation in short form

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:10,290
it is called CLM of a MOSFET Before we

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,450
jump into channel and modulation we will

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,299
first see how the characteristics of our

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,720
N channel enhancement MOSFET were in

7
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:22,470
different situations this is how the ID

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,580
versus VDS characteristics of a MOSFET

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:30,000
were when Vgs was equal to a constant

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,640
value let say which is Vgs 1 so I've

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,640
drawn these figures taking medius is

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,399
fixed which is VGs 1 and the first

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,399
figure represents when VDS is positive

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,850
and it is small so in that case we had

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,539
the entire channel and the current that

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,600
was flowing was somewhere here for the

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,079
given VDS which is very small and the

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,260
current was increasing linearly coming

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,989
to the second situation where VDS was

20
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,430
increased as the potential was higher on

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,350
the drain side there was reverse bias

22
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,270
and depletion region increased and the

23
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,369
channel thickness reduced or the

24
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,790
concentration of electrons in the

25
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,380
channel reduced due to which the

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,350
resistance increased and of course

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,170
potential increased hence we had current

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,990
increasing at a rate which is less

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,380
compared to this region and then when we

30
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,799
move on to a point where VDS was equal

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,350
to Vgs 1 minus Vth which was in fact

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,930
called the overdrive voltage when we

33
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,869
applied that potential so the potential

34
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,259
here was equal to Vgs 1 minus Vth in

35
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,360
which case the channel gets pinched off

36
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:45,000
so we have seen till this point we said

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,700
that the channel wouldn't allow any

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,470
extra current to flow beyond the current

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,990
that is flowing and pinch off hence we

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,689
took the characteristics to be constant

41
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,210
beyond the spins of point but in reality

42
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,490
the current beyond this overdrive

43
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,030
voltage is not going to be constant as

44
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,549
we discussed so now we will see why this

45
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,110
current wouldn't be constant beyond the

46
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:13,800
overdrive voltage of VDS let's say 

47
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:17,040
says about the VGs 1 minus Vth

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,900
let's say we have some voltage here now

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,020
the question is what will happen to this

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,390
channel let's just say we have we apply

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,720
a potential by increasing this beyond we

52
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,400
Vgs 1 minus vth what'll happen is here

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,700
the potential wouldn't be Vgs1

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,640
minus Vth it will be this value if the

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,250
potential is this value here as the

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,170
potential increases from source to drain

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,850
there should be a point at which the

58
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,850
potential should become Vgs 1 minus

59
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,290
Vth along the channel in which case at

60
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,330
that point the channel should get

61
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,580
pinched off and if you take that

62
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,160
scenario and draw the figure this is how

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,050
it'll look where we are assuming the

64
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,270
potential that is applied that VDS is

65
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,120
greater than Vgs 1 minus vth which is

66
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,310
plus let's say the Delta V I am taking

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,830
that this is the point at which the

68
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,160
potential across the channel would

69
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,470
become Vgs 1 minus vth which means

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,380
this Delta V would be dropping across

71
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,050
this point where the entire channel here

72
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:18,450
is completely pinched off in this case

73
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,459
if you look at the channel it looks as

74
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,800
if the channel is existing only till

75
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,300
this point when we started we assumed

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,670
the channel length is L but now the

77
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,980
channel length seems to be reduced

78
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,770
because of the extra voltage that we

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,030
applied beyond the overdrive voltage in

80
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,190
this case what would happen is the

81
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,230
electrons that are coming from source to

82
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,290
drain when they enter into this pinched

83
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,840
off region the electrons would get

84
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,670
accelerated because we have applied a

85
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,500
potential which is higher now which

86
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:52,530
means the electric field should be

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,660
higher compared to this scenario so the

88
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,180
electrons that actually come here let's

89
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,690
say the Delta V potential is getting

90
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,540
dropped here and at this point at this

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,350
point the potential would be Vgs 1 minus

92
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,239
Vth in the channel now electrons when

93
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,700
they get accelerated which means the

94
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,610
rate of flow of carriers would increase

95
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,470
now assuming the velocity of the

96
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,019
electrons haven't come to the saturation

97
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,830
velocity in which case the current would

98
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,539
increase as we increase the potential so

99
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,789
hence the current should actually be

100
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,810
increasing beyond overdrive voltage and

101
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,630
it is not going to be

102
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,470
constant like this so let me show that

103
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,370
particular curve here which would look

104
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,860
like this

105
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,620
the curve in the red color but of course

106
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,240
these two curves are for a fixed Vgs

107
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,980
which is which is Vgs1 now why is this

108
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,080
called channel length modulation because

109
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,419
if you look at here the channel seems to

110
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,660
be this value which is less than the

111
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,850
actual channel length now as we increase

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,100
this potential beyond even this value

113
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,820
this point would move here which means

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,070
from here onwards it will be like this a

115
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,960
single line kind of but if you reduce

116
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,320
this potential this point would move to

117
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,260
here which means the channel length here

118
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,520
would be actually getting more related

119
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,850
increasing and decreasing with respect

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,140
to the drain to source potential hence

121
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:19,710
it is called the channel length

122
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:24,390
modulation so let me say this is with CL

123
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,700
m and this is without CL m in fact this

124
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:31,290
point remains we offer the Tom Cruise

125
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:34,830
movie which is night and day in which he

126
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:36,990
says with me without me with me without

127
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,540
me in this case we can say this is with

128
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,270
CLM the current is higher without CLM

129
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,810
the current is less with CLM without

130
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,479
CLM

131
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,760
now let's find out how would the current

132
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,360
equation be with channel and modulation

133
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:53,700
to find out first I'm taking the

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,070
current equation in saturation region

135
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:02,220
without CLM now we know that the

136
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:04,200
channel length has reduced so we're

137
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,979
going to take the L is equal to L Prime

138
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,620
in fact L prime is equal to L minus

139
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:13,650
Delta L of course this Delta L is a

140
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,289
function of VDS that why it is called

141
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,590
channel length modulation so this can be

142
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:23,430
written equal to L taking common 1 minus

143
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:27,030
Delta L over L which is normalized value

144
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:30,600
here and of course this Delta L over L

145
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,740
will be directly proportional to VDS so

146
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,570
we can equate this with a

147
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,710
proportionality constant called lambda

148
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:41,260
times VD s so this can be equated again

149
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:45,730
as L times 1 minus lambda Vds

150
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:50,440
we will substitude this value here in

151
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:54,220
which case I D would be equal to mu Cox

152
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,190
prime W by L so L is written as L times

153
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,110
1 minus lambda VDS so this will be in

154
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,670
the denominator I am going to take this

155
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:05,320
in the numerator so that it becomes 1

156
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:09,820
minus lambda VDS power minus 1 1 minus

157
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,630
lambda VDS power minus 1 times Vgs minus

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,260
Vth

159
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:17,740
whole square over 2 taking lambda times

160
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,770
VDS is very less than 1 we can rewrite

161
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,680
this expression where if you see lambda

162
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,380
units would be volt inverse because this

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,870
is normalized even this entire time

164
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,090
should be unitless if this is volt this

165
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,960
is volt inverse hence we should not be

166
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:39,760
having unit lambda is volt inverse so

167
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:45,580
this is equal to ID times 1 plus lambda

168
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:48,790
VDs where ID is a current without

169
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,190
channel length modulation so let's put

170
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,430
this this is ID of course this ID is

171
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:56,440
different so just for convenience I am

172
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,070
putting a prime here which is a modified

173
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,110
ID which is the drain current with

174
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,820
channel length modulation is equal to

175
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,000
the drain current of without channel and

176
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,010
modulation times 1 plus lambda VDS so

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,180
let me summarize here this is channel

178
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,890
length modulation and this is without

179
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,390
channel and modulation and of course

180
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,760
going forward I wouldn't be writing this

181
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:22,230
as ID prime simply I'll write ID is

182
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,230
equal to the entire equation
