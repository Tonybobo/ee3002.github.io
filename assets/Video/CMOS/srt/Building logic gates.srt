1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
at the core of every computer are

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,690
devices that actually perform the

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,490
computations in most modern computers we

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,130
either use an Mos and P Mos

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,190
transistors as the base of most of our

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,039
operations and in this lecture we'll be

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,000
focusing on how we use these two gate RS

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,100
transistors to create logic gates

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,269
now this is the N Mos transistor itself

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,289
inside this circle and we have some

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,150
dimensions of how we use it so we

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,880
connect this lower terminal terminal 2

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,649
to ground it's sufficient just so you

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,340
know that this is the convention and you

15
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,079
can explore why in future courses and

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,719
then we have a gate which is our inputs

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,670
and that's how we control the transistor

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,789
from our perspective and that'll be a0

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,149
or a1 and then this terminal 1 connects

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,379
to other gates or the output of our

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:58,469
logic gate and then we've got our P Mos

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:03,239
transistor over here which behaves in a

23
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,369
opposite fashion we have our our

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,030
transistor here and notice this little

25
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,820
symbol that tells us this is the p MOS

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:15,210
transistor and we connect Terminal one

27
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,460
here to this high voltage VDD which is

28
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,590
usually like about 1 volt but that's

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,689
going to be varied based on the

30
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,159
technology and then we have our input

31
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,829
gate which allows us to control this

32
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,320
transistor and then terminal 2 connects

33
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,210
out to other circuits or other logic

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,880
gates and so how do we actually

35
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,610
make these work and what do these

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,579
actually do and so basically a

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,380
transistor is a electrically controlled

38
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:53,130
switch if we put a 1 in or a high

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,560
voltage the N Mos becomes a closed

40
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,909
circuit whereas the P MOS becomes an

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,299
open circuit and if we were to switch

42
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,270
off let's expose the second longer so

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,539
when this is closed or shorted there's a

44
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,480
direct path from ground up to here so

45
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,890
basically our output terminal has a 0

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
volt output

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,170
whereas this guy since there's a an open

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,540
circuit there's no current or anything

49
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,400
going through this and so this is just

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,050
basically a dangling wire there's

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,100
nothing there's nothing not connected to

52
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:34,320
anything however if we switch our inputs

53
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,110
the entire behavior changes our N mos

54
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,480
becomes an open and our PMos becomes a

55
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,320
short and so now there's a direct path

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:48,740
between our output and VDD so now this

57
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,740
is going to be our high voltage VDD and

58
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,370
keep altering these behaviors

59
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,410
being alternating between zero and once

60
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,489
and because they have opposite

61
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:04,680
functionality we call them complementary

62
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:07,080
and complementary mos or CMOS is how

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,420
we talk about NMOS and PMos as a group

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,900
and any other type of logic that has a

65
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,130
similar functionality the amazing thing

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,799
is that we can use just a PMos and NMOS

67
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:22,590
transistors to create any circuit and so

68
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,920
here we have a not gate and we'll show

69
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,840
you how this works if we have an input

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,470
of 0

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:34,670
our p-type is going to become a short

72
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:38,880
and directly connect the output to VDD

73
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:41,040
so when output is zero volts our output

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,400
what's going to have VDD volts which is

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,810
a logical one on the other hand this

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,850
this n-type is going to be open so

77
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:56,610
there's no connection between our output

78
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:59,570
and ground for if we input a 1 or VDD

79
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:03,030
volts we have a direct path between

80
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:04,860
ground and the output so our output is

81
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,070
going to have zero volts and be logical

82
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,340
zero and our p-type is going to become

83
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:15,540
an open so there's no connection between

84
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:19,940
VDD and the output and so this is how we

85
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,940
build our not gate which has this symbol

86
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,380
when we build more complicated or

87
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,490
complex digital logic circuits it

88
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,620
becomes important to notice there's

89
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,820
another part of what makes these guys

90
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,070
complimentary so down here n MOS

91
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:40,400
transistors are connected in series

92
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,150
that means the output of one is

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,750
connected as a terminal of the other

94
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:50,720
whereas our PMos up here are connected

95
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,039
in parallel where both of their outputs

96
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,199
are connected together and they're both

97
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:59,840
connected on their terminals to VDD and

98
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,690
these differing paths this parallel

99
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,400
path vs. series path is really important

100
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,229
that any time you have a PMos in

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,050
parallel you need to have an N Moss in

102
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:11,449
series they have a P Mos in series you

103
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,430
have an N Mos in parallel and that's

104
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,720
how we build our logic gates so that we

105
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,449
maintain this complementary

106
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,009
functionality now let's look at what

107
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:23,930
this circuit actually does

108
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:27,800
so let's input a 0 B  0 so an a is

109
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:31,610
0 this p MOS is going to be a short and

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:35,599
when B is 0 this p MOS is going to be a

111
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:39,680
short as well and so both these connect

112
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:44,090
our output directly to VDD so our output

113
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,010
should be a 1 and down here our a is

114
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,349
connected to our n MOS so that's going

115
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,789
to become an open and B is going to be

116
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,740
connect to this n Moss and create an

117
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:54,830
open so there's no path between ground

118
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,530
and the output so indeed our output is 1

119
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,090
and let's try another input 

120
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:04,190
combination so let's try with 0 1 and

121
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,919
when a is 0 we're gonna have a short on

122
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,800
this p MOS just like before and with b

123
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,460
is 1 this is going to create an open on

124
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,130
this p MOS a with 0 is going to create

125
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,300
an open on this n MOS and b equal 1

126
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:23,180
is going to create a short so here our

127
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,050
ground is still cut off from the output

128
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,550
but we do have a direct path from VDD

129
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,120
down to the output so output is 

130
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,370
going to be 1 now let's try the next

131
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,060
combination 1 0 this is going to be

132
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,400
exactly like the

133
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,560
for except a little bit flipped so a is

134
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,860
going to result in this being open this

135
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,510
B is going to cause us to be short and

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,870
then this a is going to cause this n mos

137
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,900
 to be shorted and this B with 0 is

138
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,760
going to cause us and must to be open so

139
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,980
again there's no path between ground in

140
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,270
the output but there will be a path

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:02,330
between VDD and the output so the output

142
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:07,010
is 1 all right one last combination to

143
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,169
go we got a is 1 B is 1 that means a is

144
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,820
going to be an open on this p mos B

145
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:14,150
is going to be an open on this P Moss

146
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,400
and then a is going to result in a short

147
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,800
on this N Mos and B is going to

148
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,570
result in a short on this N mos so

149
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,889
now we have a path between ground and

150
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,639
the output so our output is 0 and we

151
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:32,960
have no paths between VDD and the output

152
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,310
so that reinforces that this is a 0 if

153
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,900
you recognize this truth table you

154
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,890
should recognize that this is the NAND

155
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:44,180
function the not and which has the

156
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:47,330
following circuit symbol we can now use

157
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,840
this NAND gate that we constructed to

158
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:53,060
create a NAND gate if we just concatenate

159
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:59,419
this not afterwards so we've got

160
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:03,229
our NAND and this is our not and this

161
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:05,690
would result in a B is our inputs C is our

162
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,430
outputs for a NAND gate this is one

163
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,680
reason why we tend to use only NAND

164
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,139
gates in our implementation of actual

165
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,990
computers because an and gate is a lot

166
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:16,160
more complicated well anyways we'll find

167
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,530
out more about that in future lectures

168
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,320
as well so let's look at one last

169
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,080
circuit and I'll just give the punchline

170
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,550
away for this one this is nor gate and

171
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,010
we'll see exactly how this behaves I

172
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,830
want to draw attention back to these the

173
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:36,080
series versus parallel here our p MOS

174
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:39,409
are in series whereas our n MOS

175
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,599
down on the bottom here are in parallel

176
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,780
because they share that common point

177
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,580
over here and so that we should

178
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,710
hopefully reinforce the idea that we

179
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,770
always do things complementarily

180
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:56,360
p mos and n Mos so let's look at the

181
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:58,520
inputs when  a is 0 B is 0 a creates a

182
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,880
short on the PMos B creates a short on

183
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,440
this PMos and then the a comes around

184
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,890
here and creates an open on the n MOS

185
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,230
and B creates an open on this N Mos

186
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,960
so we have a direct connection between

187
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,910
VDD and the output and no path between

188
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:18,020
ground and the output so output is 1

189
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:24,170
let's try the next simple combination

190
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:28,880
with 0 1 0 creates a short here and an

191
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:32,570
open here so there's no path between VDD

192
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:36,320
and the output and then we've got 0 over

193
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:40,280
here so this guy's becomes an open but

194
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,020
the B being one here  up short for

195
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,180
this N Mos so we have a path directly

196
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,720
from ground to the output so that

197
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:52,970
creates a 0 output next in book

198
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:56,090
combination 1 0 B is 1 so we have a open

199
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,130
here and a short on this P Mos because

200
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:02,720
of the B and then this guy is going to

201
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,430
be open and this guy will be shorted so

202
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,530
now we have a different path but we

203
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,420
still have a path nonetheless from

204
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:14,960
ground to the output so our output be 0

205
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:18,500
and then we put both these as 1 both of

206
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,050
our P Mos will be open and both of

207
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,830
our n Mos will be shorted so we have

208
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:28,430
two paths from ground to the output so C

209
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:31,490
will be 0 and our output will be 0 and

210
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:37,130
this again creates a nor gate which has

211
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:40,220
the circuit symbol nor and we can

212
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:43,490
combine nor with not to create or and

213
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,590
just like our NAND we generally will

214
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,900
refer to use nor gates exclusively in

215
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,320
our designs rather than using and OR

216
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,320
and NOT
