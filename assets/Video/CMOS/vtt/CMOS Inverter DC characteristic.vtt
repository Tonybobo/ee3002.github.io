00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
in this video we will understand about
CMOS inverter transfer characteristics

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
transfer characteristics is simple it is
output voltage versus the input

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
voltage but the very first point I want
to make sure that you know all your

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.740
basics right because this is the very
important topic the five star rating so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.029
make sure you understand this topic in
depth first you should note about this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
circuit of the CMOS we have already
studied in our basics but that was the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
ideal condition if you provide the zero
word you are getting the one if you're

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.430
providing logic one you are getting this
zero it behaves as the inverter that's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.559
true because it is ideal but practically
it's different your input voltage will

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.280
have the different stages different
voltages and you will get the output

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.379
voltage as different at every stage that
is very important in the CMOS inverter

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.510
transfer characteristics we have to look
whether our p MOS is in which region at

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.480
what time of the input if my input is at
the 0 volt would whether my P Mos and n MOS

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.010
are in linear saturation or cutoff
region we are interested in that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.450
knowledge okay first point is you should
know that the CMOS is called

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.350
complementary Mo's because at the upper
side we have P Mo's lower side we have

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.310
the N Mo's so complementary MOSFET we
are using that is the reason it is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.540
called CMOS and the next point you
should note is we have the four voltages

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.470
VGs of P VGs of n VDs of P and VDs
of n now these are the four voltages

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.320
every voltage have their uniqueness they
are not same they are not same so what

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.049
are the uniqueness let us see that VDD
is 5 volt Vss is 0 volt now these are

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.170
the upper and the lower voltages VDD and
VSS so they are 5 and 0 volt but VGs

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.220
, n is input and VDs ,n is
output so now we will see why VGs

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.100
P is equal to minus of VDD minus V input
very important point we have to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.619
understand one thing that VSD is the
standard notation when we write P Mo's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.420
and it is actually Vs minus VG so you
have to check what is the source voltage

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.250
for the P Mo's it is equal to VDD and
what is the gate voltage for the P Mo's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.319
it is equal to V input so VSD
is equal to V is a vs minus VG which is

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.550
equal to VDD correct and minus V input
we have seen here that we have the VDD

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.250
at the upper side and VG is equal to V
input so if you are writing VD VG s that

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.830
is the opposite if you are writing Vgs
then it is minus X Vsg so that is the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.599
reason you are getting minus of VDD
minus V input similarly you can find it

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.540
for VDS,P if you go for the
standard notation it is Vsd Vsd is Vs

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.489
minus VD so what is the source voltage
it is VDD and what is the drain voltage

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:58.900
for the PMO's it is output so basically Vs
vs minus Vd is actually it is VDD minus

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.750
V out but you are writing in the format
of VDS, P then it would be minus of

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.700
VDD minus V out so this is the reason
this all the notations you should know

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.590
how they came up you should not rectify
this things you should know exact

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.220
meaning so I hope all the notations are
clear why Vgs is and because it can be

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.170
written as VG minus Vs for the N Mo's
and you can see here when you are

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.560
talking about why Vgs, minus V input your
VG value is been V in but your vs value

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.620
is ground so Vgs is equal to VG which
is equal to V in so that is the reason

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.260
Vgs, N is equal to V input similar
same goes for the Vbs, N and I hope

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.579
all the notations are clear up till now
but I want to make one assumption the

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.380
threshold voltage I am using VT n is
equal to 1 volt and VT P is minus 1 volt

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.120
and if you have take the common
threshold voltage it is more of VT is

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.880
equal to 1 now we can understand our
basic idea about the transfer

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.010
characteristics for the CMOS inverter so
the case number 1 is your V input is at

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.230
this 0 volt if your V input as the 0 but
you will get the V output as 5 volt and

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.729
your assumptions was Vtn is a 1 volt if
Vtp is what Vtp is minus 1 would these

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.490
are your assumptions now you are
checking in all the conditions you are

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.470
checking how my N Mo's and P Mo's are Behaving
you are checking this condition now we

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.970
will talk about the N Mo's my Vgs,n would be what from the previous slide

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.040
we know that Vgs, n is equal to V
input and we input here is 0 volt and

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.729
your 0 volt is less than your threshold
voltage because your threshold voltage

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.520
is one volt so if zero volt is less than threshold

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.380
volt your input is less than the order
required threshold volt your MOSFET

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.520
won't be on if your MOSFET won't be on
it is off this means you are in cutoff

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.800
region and your drain current is zero so
first case your n Mo's is in the cutoff

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.120
region in the case number one where your
V input is zero and V output is five

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.930
volt but what about the P Mo's we are
we want to see the condition of P Mo's

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.600
as well so in which region your P MOS is
working let us find that Vgs, P is

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.490
equal to this condition that is - time
VDD minus V input you do the calculation

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.710
you know every value VDD is 5 input is 0
after the calculation you will get minus

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.990
5 volt similarly you can find it for VT
P VTP is given its it's simple VTP is

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.000
given that is minus 1 good so you have
Vgs, p + VTP you have to check

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.270
the condition so Vgs , P is less
than VTP but in the P MOS style you have

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.610
to say that VSG which is 5 volt is
greater than 1 volt so you should know

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.490
this style because here you can say your
transistor is on because your input is

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.110
greater than your threshold this is the
correct style okay and you can say this

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.430
this style is useful for calculation
purposes but this style is important for

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.449
the conceptual purpose to find whether
your region is in linear saturation or

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.160
cutoff so here your MOSFET is on if your
MOSFET is on your next task is to ask

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.300
yourself if your MOSFET is on whether it
is linear or saturation region now we

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.280
will find that to find that you have to
check your driver voltage and your VDS

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.260
always we did that we have found the
driver voltage and the VDS we check the

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.280
condition greater or less and then we
come at turn on the answer similar thing

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.030
you are doing VDS ,P is this
equation substitute the values Vdd

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.409
you know 5 volt V output is 5 volt you
will get the answer as zero volt

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.810
similarly you have to find the driver
voltage which is VGs ,P - Vtp

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:47.190
or you can say Vsg and you should do
VSD - Vtp then also you will

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.020
get the answer do anyway you will get
the answer is minus 4 volt and once you

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.760
get the answer as minus 4 volt you have
to check in this sense of the N MOSFET

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.930
if you are going for the N mos style you
will get this because it was easy for

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.980
the calculation purpose but if you want
to go for the knowledge and conceptual

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:12.660
purpose you should check this condition
which is VSD ,p and Vsg of p

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.220
minus mod Vtp so this is the conception
where you know if it is less it is

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.090
linear but if you are going for the
calculation style your

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.169
style would be opposite if it is greater
because you are choosing the N Mos

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:29.639
style so if it is greater it is the
linear region and I have covered this in

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.540
my basics I have already said you how
you can deal either you go for the

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:37.050
calculation style that is the inverse
style then you are you have to consider

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:42.150
your conditions opposite so this is this
style one and this style number two is you

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.410
go for the P mos style and if you going
for the P mos style everything remains

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.150
same as you studied for the N Mo's so
this is style 2  - I always prefer style 2

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.080
- because conceptually it is easy but
for the calculation purpose as you can

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.979
see the step 1 and step 2
I followed the N mos style to go for

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:03.150
the P mos style what you have to do you
have to change your Vds to VSD simple

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:07.260
you have to change your driver voltage
so if it's the driver voltage of the N

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.280
mos I'll change it to driver voltage of
P mos style which will have the minus

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.660
sign present so change the sign if you
have minus 4 it would be plus 4 for the

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.370
PMO's fashion and 4 volt you have to
check that zero is less than the 4 volt

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.990
yes and it is the linear region so in
the case one we have studied that when

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:31.289
my input is zero my n MOS is in cutoff
region and my P Mo's is a linear region

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:36.990
now I will increase my input voltage so
you can see that V input is similar to

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:41.669
or greater than 1 volt then my output
will be let's say similar to 5 or it

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:47.670
should be something less than 5 so this
is my case and I want to check now my n

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.300
Mo's and P Mo's will be in which region
so it would be interesting

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.220
let us see first the N Mo's so VT s
,n is equal to V input so you can

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.540
say that VG s ,n is greater than
equal to 1 volt similarly we have the

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.000
threshold for the N mos as 1 volt you
can say that your VG s is greater than

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.560
the threshold voltage so your transistor
is on if your transistor is on it can be

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.990
linear or saturation so we are checking
whether our n MOS is linear region or

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:21.690
our n MOS is in saturation region so how
we check first we need the VDS and then

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.519
we check for the driver voltage so VDS
,n is equal to V output it is

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:31.079
similar to 5 volt or something less than
5 volt so this is our case but our

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:36.450
driver voltage is VG s ,n minus VT
n which can be written as 1 minus 1 and

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.130
that is equal to 0 because the values we
always know that Vgs,n we

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.950
know that it is input which is similar
to or greater than 1 volt and Vtn

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.870
and the value is already we have assumed
that the value is 1 so 1 minus 1 the

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:57.329
answer is 0 so surely 0 is less than 5
what does this means this means that

00:09:57.329 --> 00:10:02.490
your driver voltage is less than your Vds
so if VDS is greater than driver

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.470
voltage you are in saturation region so
your n MOS is now in saturation region

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.790
so this is interesting now we will check
for the P Mo's now we will check whether

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.579
our p MOS is a linear cutoff or
saturation region so how to check our first

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:23.579
step is always about whether our MOSFET
is on or off if it is off then you are

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:28.470
in cutoff region but if it is on then
you are in linear or saturation region

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.209
so we always follow the two steps and
for the beamers we take a special care

00:10:33.209 --> 00:10:37.770
while concluding the answer we follow
the P mos style but while doing the

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.510
calculation we follow the n MOS style so
you can see the first step VGs ,P

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.070
so this is the n MOS style and Vgs, P according to our equation it is

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:53.459
equal to minus this is VDD minus V input
so the answer is minus 4 volt now you

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:58.949
have to check in the P mos styles so you
are checking your Vsg , p value

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:04.259
which is the plus 4 because vgs was
minus 4 so Vsg

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:10.559
would be minus of minus 4 that is plus 4
and more VTP is 1 so 4 is greater than 1

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:15.209
this means your transistor is on if your
transistor is on it can be linear or

00:11:15.209 --> 00:11:19.709
saturation so tell me what is the answer
second point is checking the region so

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:23.489
how to check the region to find the
value of VDS comma P so again it is the

00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:28.619
n MOS style of calculation so it is
minus times VDD minus V out you will get

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:32.429
the answer as zero volt now you have to
find the driver voltage which is

00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:38.669
VG s comma P minus VTP you cannot here
it is not mod VT P mod Vtp is when

00:11:38.669 --> 00:11:42.359
you do the P mos style but this is the
n MOS style you have to write the

00:11:42.359 --> 00:11:48.299
negative of the value so you will get VG
s comma P which is minus 4 and VT P is

00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:53.489
minus 1 so completely it will make it as
plus 1 so minus 4 plus 1 you will get

00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:58.410
the answer as minus 3 volt now what's
next you have to check your driver

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:04.470
voltage and your VDS value if your VDS
value is now you have to check in to

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.949
style either you can go for the n MOS
style because you have done the

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:12.689
calculation in n mos style or you can
change this value in the p MOS fashion

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:17.069
and check the P Mo's condition so I will
always prefer for the P Mo's condition

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:22.289
so you can see that VSD comma P this
means I am changing the sign because my

00:12:22.289 --> 00:12:28.829
VDS was 0 so VSD would be also 0 because
0 never has its sign now what about the

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:33.389
the driver voltage driver voltage
has minus 3 volt so it will also change

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:38.069
its sign because we are dealing with the
P Mo's so we have to change its sign so

00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:43.799
minus 3 volt will be 3 volt now we can
say your 3 volt is greater than 0 volt

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:49.499
this means your video Vsd is less
than driver voltage you can say it is a

00:12:49.499 --> 00:12:55.649
linear region so conceptually
conceptually in n Mo's and P Mo's the

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:59.999
condition remains same but you have to
follow this P mos style to make sure

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:04.350
your conditions are seen so this is very
important this I have already covered in

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.759
my previous videos why you should you
always have two types this I have

00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:13.559
already covered follow the inversion for
only calculation but go for the P Mo's

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:17.840
style by concluding the answer
I have concluded my MOSFET is in linear

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.720
region now we will move forward now this
is the case 3 from my input is similar

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.640
to greater than one my input is changed
to two point five if my input is two

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.330
point five I am getting the output as
two point five so this is the special

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.470
case now you have to check whether your
n MOS is in which region and your P

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.120
mos is in which region so for the N
Mo's we will follow the same two process

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.870
MOSFET on or off and then we will check
for the linear or saturation so first of

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:53.660
your VG s comma n is equal to V input
which is 2.5 volt now your 2.5 volt is

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.380
greater than this threshold that is 1
volt this means your transistor is on

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:03.320
now the next task is to check the region
linear or saturation so VDS comma n this

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.300
is the V output which is 2.5 the driver
voltage is this and the after doing the

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:14.090
calculation you will get 1.5 volt so 2.5
is greater than 1.5 this means you are

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:20.120
in saturation region so our n MOS is in
saturation region what about P Mo's so

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.530
now we will check for P Mo's again we
have to follow the two steps first step

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:31.040
is Vgs comma P that is equal to minus
VDD minus V input and the answer is

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.670
minus 2.5
now you have to check your transistor is

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:40.370
on or off in P Mo's so this is the P
Mo's logic for the transistor on what is

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:46.220
that Vsg comma P should be greater than
mod of VTP so already you have vgs to

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:51.950
find vsg change the sign so you will
get 2.5 volt and mod of VTP is mod of

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.660
minus 1 so the answer is 1 so yes 2
point 5 is greater than 1 then your

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:01.100
transistor is on if your transistor is
on which is the region let's check the

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:06.500
region so what is the first step VD s
comma P this is equal to minus VDD minus

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.780
V out just substitute the values all the
values you have the answer is minus 2.5

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.220
driver voltage substitute the value you
will get the answer as minus 1 point 5

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:22.730
to get the condition you should be in
the P MOS fashion now you got VDS find

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.580
the value of the
design for minus 2.5 becomes plus 2.5

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.769
now you have the value of driver voltage
change its sign because driver voltage

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:38.399
is actually for n MOS you follow this type
for P Mo's it changes its side so minus

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:49.829
1.5 will change its sign to plus 1.5
always do the calculation in n Mo's by dealing with P Mo's what you
have to do change sign change sign

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:52.800
simple logic
you have to follow this you will never

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.600
fail in track so 2.5 greater than 1.5 so
your answer is saturation region and

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.550
because your VSD is greater than driver
voltage now the case number 4 is

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.380
interesting your V input is gradually
increasing so V input is similar to or

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:12.060
greater than 4 whereas your V output is
similar to 1 volt

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:17.100
similar to 1 or less than 1 so what
would be n Mo's and P Mo's in the form

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.870
of region saturation region linear
region so you have to find that what you

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.610
can do is follow the two steps so Vgs
comma n is V input it is similar to

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:30.630
greater than 4 volt surely or 4 volt is
greater than your threshold value so

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:35.190
transistor is on now you have to note
whether your n MOS is in linear or

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:40.350
saturation region so VD s comma n is
equal to V output which is similar to or

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.329
less than 1 volt then you have your
driver voltage as VG s comma n minus VT

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:50.220
and substitute the value for minus 1 the
answer is 3 volt so you can say your VD

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.779
s is less than the driver voltage
because 1 is less than 3 and that is the

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:59.610
reason your n MOS is in linear region
now we will deal with P Mo's so VG s

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:04.559
comma P is equal to minus VDD minus V
input you will get the answer as minus 1

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:09.750
volt then Vsg comma P you have to find
that value that means inversion of what

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:15.030
we have done so invert this sign you
will get plus 1 mod VT P is also plus 1

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:20.250
so actually we have done this that it
should be greater than or similar to

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:25.110
minus 1 so this value is greater than or
similar to this correct so basically it

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:30.390
is greater so if it is greater than your
transistor is on you should have your

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:34.700
Vsg that is the input for P Mo's greater
than your threshold voltage then

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.440
only your MOSFET would be on so here yes it is
similar to greater this means it is a

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.940
greater and your MOSFET is on now check
for the region so to check the region

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.620
it's simple what you have to do two
steps VDS comma P and vo p which is v VT

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.810
s comma P minus VT P substitute the
values in both the cases minus 4 volt of

00:17:53.810 --> 00:18:00.230
VDS comma p 0 volt for driver voltage do
it in the p mos style which means change

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.990
the sign
so Vsg comma p the answer is plus

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:07.490
4 volt and change the driver voltage
sign it is again the zero volt so 4 is

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.210
greater than zero so answer is
saturation region because your vs g is

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:16.130
greater than the driver voltage so the
last case we have is the case number 5

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.020
where the V input is maximum that is 5
volt and the output is super minimum

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.460
that is zero volt so let us step for the
N Mo's in which region the n MOS is

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:31.850
working so Vgs comma n is 5 volt Vtn
is 1 volt so 5 volt is greater than 1

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:38.030
your MOSFET is on next step VD s comma n
zero volt driver voltage is 4 volt so 0

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:42.410
volt is less than the 4 volt so it is in
linear region so this is interesting

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.790
again you got your n MOS in the linear
region so we will deal with P Mo's now

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.710
to deal with P Mo's you should first
find the VG s comma P which is minus VDD

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:57.170
minus V input so the answer is zero volt
but your  Vtp is minus one so your

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:03.500
vgs is zero volt so vs g would be
zero volt again but your VT p is minus 1

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:10.310
volt so more VT p is one volt check
this two

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.200
is what zero volt your mod VT p is 1 so
what is the relation the relation is

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:21.230
your vs g comma p is less than mod Vtp
this means your MOSFET is on off

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:27.560
and if your MOSFET is off this means you
are in cutoff region so here in case

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.840
number 5 the P mos is in cutoff region
so this is the DC characteristics of the

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.720
CMOS inverter y-axis as the output
x-axis has the input and these are the 5

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:44.750
cases when V input is minimum that is
equal to 0 what is similar to 0 volt

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.350
then it's similar to one volt then is
similar to 2.5 there is greater than 2

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.090
point five  then it is in the fifth case
it was super Maximum that is the 5 volt so

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.290
this were the cases we covered I just
wanted to remind you about the cases we

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.840
have deal with and we have seen how our
MOSFET works in each case in each case n

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.670
Mo's and P Mo's have different working
but only in the case number 3 n Mo's and

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:13.950
P Mo's had the same working that is the
saturation region so here are some

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:19.260
notations this value is Vtn that is the threshold voltage of n Mo's

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:24.390
and here somewhere here you will get the
VT P threshold voltage for the P Mo's

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.640
then you have the VI L that is the input
flow voltage input high voltage

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.070
somewhere here and you will have the
middle value as VDD by 2 that that's

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:40.559
what we consider in case number 3
similar to 2.5 and then we have this

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:46.679
input high voltage we have this VDD plus
mod of VT P here we have to take the

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:51.419
positive value of the threshold and
lastly we have the VDD my input

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:56.400
is high super high that is VDD then my
output is 0 so this is the curve this

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.000
represent is the transfer
characteristics DC characteristics now

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.120
we will see what were the regions this
were the regions 1 2 3 4 5 correct and

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.160
how ourMOSFET work in this regions so
this is the conclusion in the case

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:18.720
number one where my input is minimum and
my output is maximum that is VDD then my

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.520
n Mo's was cutoff region P Mo's was
linear region here when my V input is

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.710
similar to greater than 1 then my V
output is less than 5 volt then my n MOS

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:34.020
is in saturation P MOS is in linear when
we input and we output as same that is

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:39.540
2.5 the answer was saturation saturation
and fourth condition when my V input is

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:44.309
greater and V output becomes less that
is V input is greater than 2.5 and V

00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:49.799
output is less than similar to 1 then my
answer is n MOS is in linear p MOS is in

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:55.110
saturation and at very large when my V
input is maximum 5 volt then my output

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.860
is minimum that is
so you can say your n mos is in linear

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.540
region and P Mos is in cutoff region
all the calculation we have seen so I

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:09.030
hope you had the brief idea about CMOS
inverter DC characteristics and this are

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.150
the some of the points you should know
so that whenever you are dealing with

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:17.760
the drain current you know exactly which
equation to use because if you are now

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.640
if you are dealing with the drain
current for N Mo's and the drain current

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.260
for P Mo's it won't be same it would be
different at some position let's say

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:29.820
case two you have to use the drain
current for saturation region for the

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.900
n mos for the P Mo's it would be
linear region so this are the important

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.580
point that is the reason we have studied
the practical working of the CMOS

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.350
inverter so practically it will work in
this five condition so this is all about

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.270
these CMOS inverter I hope you enjoyed
