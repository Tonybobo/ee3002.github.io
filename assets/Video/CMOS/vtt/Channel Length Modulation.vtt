00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.259
in this video we are going to say

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.410
channel length modulation in short form

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.290
it is called CLM of a MOSFET Before we

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
jump into channel and modulation we will

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.299
first see how the characteristics of our

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.720
N channel enhancement MOSFET were in

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.470
different situations this is how the ID

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.580
versus VDS characteristics of a MOSFET

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.000
were when Vgs was equal to a constant

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.640
value let say which is Vgs 1 so I've

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.640
drawn these figures taking medius is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.399
fixed which is VGs 1 and the first

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.399
figure represents when VDS is positive

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.850
and it is small so in that case we had

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.539
the entire channel and the current that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.600
was flowing was somewhere here for the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.079
given VDS which is very small and the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.260
current was increasing linearly coming

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.989
to the second situation where VDS was

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.430
increased as the potential was higher on

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.350
the drain side there was reverse bias

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.270
and depletion region increased and the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.369
channel thickness reduced or the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.790
concentration of electrons in the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.380
channel reduced due to which the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.350
resistance increased and of course

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.170
potential increased hence we had current

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.990
increasing at a rate which is less

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.380
compared to this region and then when we

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.799
move on to a point where VDS was equal

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.350
to Vgs 1 minus Vth which was in fact

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.930
called the overdrive voltage when we

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.869
applied that potential so the potential

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.259
here was equal to Vgs 1 minus Vth in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.360
which case the channel gets pinched off

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.000
so we have seen till this point we said

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.700
that the channel wouldn't allow any

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.470
extra current to flow beyond the current

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.990
that is flowing and pinch off hence we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.689
took the characteristics to be constant

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.210
beyond the spins of point but in reality

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.490
the current beyond this overdrive

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.030
voltage is not going to be constant as

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.549
we discussed so now we will see why this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.110
current wouldn't be constant beyond the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.800
overdrive voltage of VDS let's say

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.040
says about the VGs 1 minus Vth

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.900
let's say we have some voltage here now

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.020
the question is what will happen to this

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.390
channel let's just say we have we apply

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.720
a potential by increasing this beyond we

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.400
Vgs 1 minus vth what'll happen is here

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.700
the potential wouldn't be Vgs1

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.640
minus Vth it will be this value if the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.250
potential is this value here as the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.170
potential increases from source to drain

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.850
there should be a point at which the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.850
potential should become Vgs 1 minus

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.290
Vth along the channel in which case at

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.330
that point the channel should get

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.580
pinched off and if you take that

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.160
scenario and draw the figure this is how

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.050
it'll look where we are assuming the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.270
potential that is applied that VDS is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.120
greater than Vgs 1 minus vth which is

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.310
plus let's say the Delta V I am taking

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.830
that this is the point at which the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.160
potential across the channel would

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.470
become Vgs 1 minus vth which means

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.380
this Delta V would be dropping across

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.050
this point where the entire channel here

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.450
is completely pinched off in this case

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.459
if you look at the channel it looks as

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.800
if the channel is existing only till

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.300
this point when we started we assumed

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.670
the channel length is L but now the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.980
channel length seems to be reduced

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.770
because of the extra voltage that we

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.030
applied beyond the overdrive voltage in

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.190
this case what would happen is the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.230
electrons that are coming from source to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.290
drain when they enter into this pinched

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.840
off region the electrons would get

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.670
accelerated because we have applied a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.500
potential which is higher now which

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.530
means the electric field should be

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.660
higher compared to this scenario so the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.180
electrons that actually come here let's

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.690
say the Delta V potential is getting

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.540
dropped here and at this point at this

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.350
point the potential would be Vgs 1 minus

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.239
Vth in the channel now electrons when

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.700
they get accelerated which means the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.610
rate of flow of carriers would increase

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.470
now assuming the velocity of the

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.019
electrons haven't come to the saturation

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.830
velocity in which case the current would

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.539
increase as we increase the potential so

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.789
hence the current should actually be

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.810
increasing beyond overdrive voltage and

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.630
it is not going to be

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.470
constant like this so let me show that

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.370
particular curve here which would look

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.860
like this

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.620
the curve in the red color but of course

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.240
these two curves are for a fixed Vgs

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.980
which is which is Vgs1 now why is this

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.080
called channel length modulation because

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.419
if you look at here the channel seems to

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.660
be this value which is less than the

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.850
actual channel length now as we increase

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.100
this potential beyond even this value

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.820
this point would move here which means

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.070
from here onwards it will be like this a

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.960
single line kind of but if you reduce

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.320
this potential this point would move to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.260
here which means the channel length here

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.520
would be actually getting more related

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.850
increasing and decreasing with respect

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.140
to the drain to source potential hence

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.710
it is called the channel length

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:24.390
modulation so let me say this is with CL

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:26.700
m and this is without CL m in fact this

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.290
point remains we offer the Tom Cruise

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.830
movie which is night and day in which he

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.990
says with me without me with me without

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.540
me in this case we can say this is with

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.270
CLM the current is higher without CLM

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.810
the current is less with CLM without

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.479
CLM

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.760
now let's find out how would the current

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.360
equation be with channel and modulation

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.700
to find out first I'm taking the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.070
current equation in saturation region

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:02.220
without CLM now we know that the

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.200
channel length has reduced so we're

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.979
going to take the L is equal to L Prime

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.620
in fact L prime is equal to L minus

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.650
Delta L of course this Delta L is a

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.289
function of VDS that why it is called

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.590
channel length modulation so this can be

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:23.430
written equal to L taking common 1 minus

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:27.030
Delta L over L which is normalized value

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:30.600
here and of course this Delta L over L

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.740
will be directly proportional to VDS so

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.570
we can equate this with a

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.710
proportionality constant called lambda

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:41.260
times VD s so this can be equated again

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:45.730
as L times 1 minus lambda Vds

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:50.440
we will substitude this value here in

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:54.220
which case I D would be equal to mu Cox

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:57.190
prime W by L so L is written as L times

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.110
1 minus lambda VDS so this will be in

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.670
the denominator I am going to take this

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:05.320
in the numerator so that it becomes 1

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:09.820
minus lambda VDS power minus 1 1 minus

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.630
lambda VDS power minus 1 times Vgs minus

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.260
Vth

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:17.740
whole square over 2 taking lambda times

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.770
VDS is very less than 1 we can rewrite

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:23.680
this expression where if you see lambda

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.380
units would be volt inverse because this

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.870
is normalized even this entire time

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.090
should be unitless if this is volt this

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.960
is volt inverse hence we should not be

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:39.760
having unit lambda is volt inverse so

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:45.580
this is equal to ID times 1 plus lambda

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:48.790
VDs where ID is a current without

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:51.190
channel length modulation so let's put

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:54.430
this this is ID of course this ID is

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.440
different so just for convenience I am

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.070
putting a prime here which is a modified

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.110
ID which is the drain current with

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.820
channel length modulation is equal to

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:07.000
the drain current of without channel and

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.010
modulation times 1 plus lambda VDS so

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.180
let me summarize here this is channel

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.890
length modulation and this is without

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.390
channel and modulation and of course

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.760
going forward I wouldn't be writing this

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:22.230
as ID prime simply I'll write ID is

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.230
equal to the entire equation
