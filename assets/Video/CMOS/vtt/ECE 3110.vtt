00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.280
in this note we're going to talk about the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.969
voltages that define different Mosfet

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.969
regions of operation

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.500
we'll start with an N mos device

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.070
we have the cutoff region

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.540
that is defined as the gate-to-source

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.560
voltage being less than the threshold

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.700
voltage for the device if the gate to

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.460
source voltage is less than the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.460
threshold device we are operating in cutoff

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.560
for gate to source voltage greater than

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:11.070
the threshold voltage we have to check to

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.990
see if

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.180
the gate to source voltage minus the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.410
threshold if the drain to source voltage

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.550
is greater than the gate to source

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:25.170
voltage minus the threshold so the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:29.580
drain to source is greater than the gate

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.500
to source minus at threshold voltage the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.500
device is in saturation

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:46.049
if the drain to source is less than the

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.049
gate to source

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:56.549
minus the threshold voltage the devices in

00:01:49.830 --> 00:02:00.409
the triode or linear region now one

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.409
thing that we can do is know

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.200
the VDS

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.200
minus  VGS

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.830
must be greater than minus Vt

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.830
or if we multiply everything through by

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:29.540
a negative then we could write that the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.540
VGS minus VDS is

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.920
must be less than VT

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.280
because the source is common to both vgs

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.390
and VDS we could also just write the Vgd

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:51.460
must be less than threshold voltage this

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.460
is the case and we're in saturation

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.720
otherwise

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.720
we are in triode/linear

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.360
when dealing with a p-mos device the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.610
easiest thing to do is just reverse the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.250
voltages on all these devices so for

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.790
instance we could write it for cut

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:25.650
off VSG

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:32.489
is less than absolute value of VT for a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:38.549
P-mos device if the VSG is greater

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.019
than VT for P mos device then we need

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.349
to check the drain to source condition

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:48.180
so we could write VSD must be greater

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:52.590
than the VSG minus the absolute value of

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.220
the threshold voltage in this case we're

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.220
in saturation

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:05.400
if VSD is less than the VSG minus the absolute

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.849
value of the threshold voltage in the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.849
device is in the triode or linear region

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:29.169
one other note we mentioned that the

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:32.270
channel capacitance is equal to Cox

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.330
times the width of the device times the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.919
length I wanted it to be clear what we

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:44.330
meant by width and length so the length is

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.930
the length between the source

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.930
terminal

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.900
separated by the gate of the transistor

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:58.500
so this dimension is the length but width

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.449
is imagine if we sketch this device into

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.449
three dimensions the width is

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.270
that third dimension

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:16.400
now we also noted that Cox is equal

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.460
to eox / tox and this is the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.620
capacitance per unit area for a device t

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.620
ox is the thickness of the oxide

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.580
and Eox is equal to

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.360
the permeability of free space times the

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.099
relativev permittivity of

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.939
the material in this case silicon

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:43.219
dioxide and our relative permittivity

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:46.789
for our permittivity of free space is

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:52.159
equal to 8.854 times ten to the minus

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:55.399
twelve farads per meter and the relative

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:58.959
permittivity of silicon dioxide is

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:58.959
approximately equal to four

00:05:59.299 --> 00:06:02.939
so with all of those equations you

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:06.899
should now be able to solve for any Mos

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:09.229
device bias region
