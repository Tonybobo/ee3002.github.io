00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
at the core of every computer are

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.690
devices that actually perform the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
computations in most modern computers we

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.130
either use an Mos and P Mos

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.190
transistors as the base of most of our

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.039
operations and in this lecture we'll be

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.000
focusing on how we use these two gate RS

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.100
transistors to create logic gates

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.269
now this is the N Mos transistor itself

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.289
inside this circle and we have some

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.150
dimensions of how we use it so we

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.880
connect this lower terminal terminal 2

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
to ground it's sufficient just so you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.340
know that this is the convention and you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.079
can explore why in future courses and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.719
then we have a gate which is our inputs

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.670
and that's how we control the transistor

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.789
from our perspective and that'll be a0

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.149
or a1 and then this terminal 1 connects

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:55.379
to other gates or the output of our

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.469
logic gate and then we've got our P Mos

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.239
transistor over here which behaves in a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.369
opposite fashion we have our our

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.030
transistor here and notice this little

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.820
symbol that tells us this is the p MOS

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:15.210
transistor and we connect Terminal one

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.460
here to this high voltage VDD which is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
usually like about 1 volt but that's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.689
going to be varied based on the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.159
technology and then we have our input

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.829
gate which allows us to control this

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.320
transistor and then terminal 2 connects

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.210
out to other circuits or other logic

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.880
gates and so how do we actually

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.610
make these work and what do these

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.579
actually do and so basically a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:49.380
transistor is a electrically controlled

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:53.130
switch if we put a 1 in or a high

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.560
voltage the N Mos becomes a closed

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.909
circuit whereas the P MOS becomes an

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.299
open circuit and if we were to switch

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.270
off let's expose the second longer so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.539
when this is closed or shorted there's a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.480
direct path from ground up to here so

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.890
basically our output terminal has a 0

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560
volt output

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.170
whereas this guy since there's a an open

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.540
circuit there's no current or anything

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.400
going through this and so this is just

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.050
basically a dangling wire there's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.100
nothing there's nothing not connected to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:34.320
anything however if we switch our inputs

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.110
the entire behavior changes our N mos

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.480
becomes an open and our PMos becomes a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.320
short and so now there's a direct path

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:48.740
between our output and VDD so now this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.740
is going to be our high voltage VDD and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.370
keep altering these behaviors

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.410
being alternating between zero and once

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.489
and because they have opposite

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.680
functionality we call them complementary

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:07.080
and complementary mos or CMOS is how

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.420
we talk about NMOS and PMos as a group

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.900
and any other type of logic that has a

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.130
similar functionality the amazing thing

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.799
is that we can use just a PMos and NMOS

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.590
transistors to create any circuit and so

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.920
here we have a not gate and we'll show

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.840
you how this works if we have an input

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.470
of 0

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.670
our p-type is going to become a short

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.880
and directly connect the output to VDD

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.040
so when output is zero volts our output

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.400
what's going to have VDD volts which is

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.810
a logical one on the other hand this

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.850
this n-type is going to be open so

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.610
there's no connection between our output

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.570
and ground for if we input a 1 or VDD

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.030
volts we have a direct path between

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.860
ground and the output so our output is

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.070
going to have zero volts and be logical

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.340
zero and our p-type is going to become

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:15.540
an open so there's no connection between

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:19.940
VDD and the output and so this is how we

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.940
build our not gate which has this symbol

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.380
when we build more complicated or

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.490
complex digital logic circuits it

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.620
becomes important to notice there's

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.820
another part of what makes these guys

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.070
complimentary so down here n MOS

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.400
transistors are connected in series

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.150
that means the output of one is

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.750
connected as a terminal of the other

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.720
whereas our PMos up here are connected

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.039
in parallel where both of their outputs

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.199
are connected together and they're both

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:59.840
connected on their terminals to VDD and

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:02.690
these differing paths this parallel

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.400
path vs. series path is really important

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.229
that any time you have a PMos in

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.050
parallel you need to have an N Moss in

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.449
series they have a P Mos in series you

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.430
have an N Mos in parallel and that's

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.720
how we build our logic gates so that we

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.449
maintain this complementary

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.009
functionality now let's look at what

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.930
this circuit actually does

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:27.800
so let's input a 0 B  0 so an a is

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:31.610
0 this p MOS is going to be a short and

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.599
when B is 0 this p MOS is going to be a

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:39.680
short as well and so both these connect

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:44.090
our output directly to VDD so our output

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.010
should be a 1 and down here our a is

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.349
connected to our n MOS so that's going

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.789
to become an open and B is going to be

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.740
connect to this n Moss and create an

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.830
open so there's no path between ground

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.530
and the output so indeed our output is 1

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.090
and let's try another input

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.190
combination so let's try with 0 1 and

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.919
when a is 0 we're gonna have a short on

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.800
this p MOS just like before and with b

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.460
is 1 this is going to create an open on

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.130
this p MOS a with 0 is going to create

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.300
an open on this n MOS and b equal 1

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:23.180
is going to create a short so here our

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.050
ground is still cut off from the output

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.550
but we do have a direct path from VDD

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.120
down to the output so output is

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:34.370
going to be 1 now let's try the next

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.060
combination 1 0 this is going to be

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.400
exactly like the

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.560
for except a little bit flipped so a is

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.860
going to result in this being open this

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.510
B is going to cause us to be short and

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.870
then this a is going to cause this n mos

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:50.900
to be shorted and this B with 0 is

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.760
going to cause us and must to be open so

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.980
again there's no path between ground in

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.270
the output but there will be a path

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:02.330
between VDD and the output so the output

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:07.010
is 1 all right one last combination to

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:09.169
go we got a is 1 B is 1 that means a is

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.820
going to be an open on this p mos B

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.150
is going to be an open on this P Moss

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.400
and then a is going to result in a short

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.800
on this N Mos and B is going to

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.570
result in a short on this N mos so

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.889
now we have a path between ground and

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:28.639
the output so our output is 0 and we

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:32.960
have no paths between VDD and the output

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:34.310
so that reinforces that this is a 0 if

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.900
you recognize this truth table you

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.890
should recognize that this is the NAND

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:44.180
function the not and which has the

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:47.330
following circuit symbol we can now use

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:50.840
this NAND gate that we constructed to

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.060
create a NAND gate if we just concatenate

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:59.419
this not afterwards so we've got

00:07:53.060 --> 00:08:03.229
our NAND and this is our not and this

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:05.690
would result in a B is our inputs C is our

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:07.430
outputs for a NAND gate this is one

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.680
reason why we tend to use only NAND

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.139
gates in our implementation of actual

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.990
computers because an and gate is a lot

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.160
more complicated well anyways we'll find

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.530
out more about that in future lectures

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.320
as well so let's look at one last

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:23.080
circuit and I'll just give the punchline

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.550
away for this one this is nor gate and

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.010
we'll see exactly how this behaves I

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.830
want to draw attention back to these the

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:36.080
series versus parallel here our p MOS

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:39.409
are in series whereas our n MOS

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.599
down on the bottom here are in parallel

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.780
because they share that common point

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:46.580
over here and so that we should

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.710
hopefully reinforce the idea that we

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.770
always do things complementarily

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:56.360
p mos and n Mos so let's look at the

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:58.520
inputs when  a is 0 B is 0 a creates a

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.880
short on the PMos B creates a short on

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.440
this PMos and then the a comes around

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.890
here and creates an open on the n MOS

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.230
and B creates an open on this N Mos

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:11.960
so we have a direct connection between

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:15.910
VDD and the output and no path between

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:18.020
ground and the output so output is 1

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:24.170
let's try the next simple combination

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:28.880
with 0 1 0 creates a short here and an

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:32.570
open here so there's no path between VDD

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:36.320
and the output and then we've got 0 over

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:40.280
here so this guy's becomes an open but

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.020
the B being one here  up short for

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.180
this N Mos so we have a path directly

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.720
from ground to the output so that

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:52.970
creates a 0 output next in book

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:56.090
combination 1 0 B is 1 so we have a open

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.130
here and a short on this P Mos because

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:02.720
of the B and then this guy is going to

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:04.430
be open and this guy will be shorted so

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.530
now we have a different path but we

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:10.420
still have a path nonetheless from

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:14.960
ground to the output so our output be 0

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:18.500
and then we put both these as 1 both of

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:21.050
our P Mos will be open and both of

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:24.830
our n Mos will be shorted so we have

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:28.430
two paths from ground to the output so C

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:31.490
will be 0 and our output will be 0 and

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:37.130
this again creates a nor gate which has

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:40.220
the circuit symbol nor and we can

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:43.490
combine nor with not to create or and

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.590
just like our NAND we generally will

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.900
refer to use nor gates exclusively in

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.320
our designs rather than using and OR

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.320
and NOT
