00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.540
memory chip design is the first step in

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.309
the production of microns memory chips

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.560
this process involves the use of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.750
computer aided design tools to lay out

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.940
billions of electronic components that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.990
store data on the chip according to the

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:30.689
product design specification during

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.730
technology development specific process

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.800
steps are defined and integrated into a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.949
process flow that will build the memory

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.960
chips the process steps are tested and

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.830
refined until the process note is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.970
qualified and ramped in manufacturing

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.350
[Music]

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.720
individual memory chips or die

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.500
are built upon pure silicon wafers in a

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.210
fabrication area or fab Fab Tsar

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
state-of-the-art clean rooms that are

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.190
100 times cleaner than a hospital

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.390
operating room to ensure silicon wafers

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.280
are protected from ambient contamination

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.950
among the many process areas in a fab

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.259
the photolithography area coats wafers

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.630
with a photo resistant material then

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.939
like film and a camera circuit patterns

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.689
are exposed and excess material is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.600
rinsed away the paths in these circuits

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.710
are 5,000 times narrower than a human

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.079
hair wafers are moved between different

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.780
tools and processes using a robotic

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.649
automated material handling system or a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.799
MHS each wafer may be moved through more

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.780
than a thousand processes it takes more

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.780
than one month to make a memory chip

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.190
in probe initial functionality tasks are

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.410
performed on each die on the wafer a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.930
probe card positions probe needles onto

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.720
each die to send and receive test data

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.660
this information is used to generate a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.940
map of all the die on each wafer only

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.830
good die that pass all tests in probe

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:17.750
will continue through the manufacturing

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:20.930
process in assembly wafers are first

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.350
thinned attached to an adhesive backing

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.260
and then diced into individual die using

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.020
a diamond two-edged saw using the wafer

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.910
map that was created in probe individual

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.880
