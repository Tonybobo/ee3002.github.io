00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:11.870
so in this video I'm going to be talking

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:13.620
about the MOSFET IV characteristics and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.690
specifically I'm going to be talking

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.060
about what's called the long channel

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.189
model and what that means will hopefully

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.380
be clear in a second so I'm assuming

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.269
that you've you're taking a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
semiconductor physics course and you

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:39.260
encountered this equation IDs equals mu

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:45.570
n si ox W over L times vgs minus VT

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:48.480
times VDS minus one-half VDS squared and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.789
you're just thrown the equation were

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.640
just thrown at you maybe very briefly

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.260
they went over where it came from but

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.120
essentially they just throw it at you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.800
and expect you to memorize it in this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
video I'm gonna try to go over where

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.619
exactly this equation comes from and so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.570
this is also known as MOSFET operating

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.240
in the triode region and so I'm gonna

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
try to describe the model behind where

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.100
this equation comes from and how we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.500
actually arrive at it so it turns out

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.439
that the model is actually pretty scheme

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.310
pretty simple actually a scarily simple so

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.860
if we've got to say we've got a MOSFET

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.850
right here so this is going to be our

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:41.640
gate we've got some gates got some

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:43.979
thickness here so it's got some metal up

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.470
top probably copper or aluminum or

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.299
polysilicon let's just say it's a little

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.470
numb or something then we've got an

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.200
oxide which essentially protects the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.030
gate or protects the rest of the MOSFET

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:05.270
from the gate and we've got our P

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:07.649
substrate our n + Wells this is a n Moss

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.379
MOSFET and so I'm assuming that you've

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.390
seen all this before and so the model

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.710
that we're going to use is basically

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.390
we're going to ignore

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.810
all the complicated stuff and just

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.380
pretend that we only care about this

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.000
region here the channel and specifically

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.010
we're assuming that the channel is just

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.280
comprised of a bunch of charges and here

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.720
they're assumes to be actually negative

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.200
charges because this is an NMOS

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:42.780
transistor so we've got a bunch of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.590
negative charges piling up here and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.440
we're interested in the current from the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.810
source to the drain so we're interested

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.550
or typically we're interested in the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.820
current from the drain to the source or

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.810
the electron flow from the source to the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.170
drain IDs so we want an equation for

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.570
ideas we want IDs equals what what does

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.950
it depend on and I've already told you

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.230
the answer up here but how do we

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.890
actually get to that answer and how can

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.070
we remember that answer well we know

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.820
that a MOSFET behaves like a variable

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.690
capacitor right so if we've got a if we

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.940
apply a certain voltage to the gate

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.200
nothing happens

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.150
we're increasing the voltage nothing

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.440
happens nothing happens and then all of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.230
a sudden we'll start to get these

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.360
carriers accumulate near the edge at a

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:44.400
certain threshold voltage so at VG and

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:47.580
we'll just say VG C because this is the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.070
voltage relative to the channel or the

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.190
little portion of the substrate that we

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.440
care about so at VGC equals the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:03.540
threshold voltage we start getting

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.340
charge accumulation at the interface so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.670
we start getting negative charges piling

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.650
up here and positive charges piling up

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.180
on the gate now as we increase the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.870
voltage on the gate there are always

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.720
charges piling up on the gate but the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.500
p-type substrate has too many positive

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.419
charges such that the channel doesn't

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.070
actually look like it has any negative

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.400
charge so we have to overcome that

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.950
first so this is all that we're going to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.740
use to derive this model we're gonna

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.950
assume that this MOSFET acts like a

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.420
capacitor and we know that the charge of

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.730
a capacitor is just equal to the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.350
capacitance times the voltage except in

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.390
our case it takes a certain voltage

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.030
before the MOSFET starts acting like a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.650
capacitor so we're gonna change this a

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.630
little bit we're gonna say that Q is

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.020
equal to the capacitance times some

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.570
voltage minus the threshold voltage and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.510
so this is the equation that we're we're

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.100
going to start with well we're not

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.040
actually interested in the charge we're

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.690
interested in the current and how did

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.090
how do we relate the - well we know if

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:15.400
we've got say we've got a cube of charge

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:19.060
here and it's got some value Q we know

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.150
that the current so the current flowing

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.830
through some plane here the charge block

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.340
is just moving along minding its own

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.670
business

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.970
the current is just how long it takes

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.880
this block of charge to move through

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:38.020
this plane so it's the total charge

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.740
divided by the time that it takes and so

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.730
up until the charge block reaches the

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.110
reaches the plane we don't have any

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.300
current and then all of a sudden we

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.400
start having current as the as the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.750
charge block transitions through the

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.990
through the plane well okay what is what

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.550
is the time it takes a charge block to

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.060
transition through the through the plane

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:04.810
well we know the the charge block has a

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.870
certain length to it right so and it's

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.170
got a certain velocity V so the time

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.660
that it takes is just the length divided

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.030
by the velocity well that's that's

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.700
fairly simple right so we can rearrange

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.340
our or plug that into our equation we

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:25.180
say that I is equal to Q or the total

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:30.760
charge of our block divided by L over V

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:32.440
or Q divided by L times V and V here is

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.570
the velocity so why don't we call this

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.100
like EQ of the velocity of the charge

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.310
block Q

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.280
well okay so from this from this where

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:47.060
do we go well if we want to know the

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.580
charge of a capacitor recall that we've

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.930
got a capacitor here we know that the

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:59.140
charge is just CV or as we said above C

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:01.730
V minus vthreshold so we can add that in

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:05.060
we've got the capacitance V minus

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:10.040
vthreshold divided by the length times

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.750
the velocity of the charge block and if

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.050
you've taken semiconductor physics

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.420
you'll know that Ohm's law on the

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.480
microscopic level just says that the

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.050
velocity of a given charge charged

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.880
particle is just equal to the mobility

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:30.020
times of that charged particle times the

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.460
electric field so we can replace that in

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:36.230
our equation we're starting to get

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:40.100
Chardonnay closer and I'm going to

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.780
replace this V with V G C the voltage

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.340
between the gate and the channel just so

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:45.680
it's clear what voltage we're talking

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.860
about and the reason I'm replacing this

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.920
V velocity as quickly as I can and so we

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.040
don't have multiple V's floating around

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:57.770
so that's equal to C VG minus VT times

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.210
the mobility times the electric field

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:03.680
divided by the length well okay you can

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.210
probably guess what we're gonna do next

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.970
we're gonna use another elementary

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.400
formula to figure out the rest of these

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.920
things so what is the capacitance what

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.840
is the electric field now we're assuming

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.640
that we know the mobility we're assuming

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.900
that we know the dimensions of this

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:24.260
thing so that those are the those the

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.270
only assumptions that we make well onto

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.590
capacitance so we know that the

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.040
capacitance of a parallel plate

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:35.180
capacitor that's filled with some

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.849
dielectric of permittivity epsilon we

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.450
know that the capacitance is just the

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:43.160
area times that epsilon divided by the

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:47.240
thickness or the distance between the

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.980
two plates here we call this t ox or the

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.860
thickness of the oxide because that's

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.990
the thickness of

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:56.570
capacitance or the dielectric that were

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.370
that were interested in and area we can

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.190
just rewrite as the width of the

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:05.420
transistor times the length of the

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:07.100
transistor so W times L times epsilon

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:11.209
divided by the thickness of the oxide

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:14.149
and so that's we just plug that back

00:09:11.209 --> 00:09:16.730
into the equation so W times L times

00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:19.399
epsilon divided by thickness of the

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:23.209
oxide and then we've got another L on

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:29.620
the bottom and then that's multiplied by

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:32.089
mu e times VG e or VG C minus VT and

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.310
sorry if the equation is starting to get

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:36.470
a little a little complicated we're

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.870
going to simplify it right now so first

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:43.490
these ELLs are going to cancel out and

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:47.569
we're going to group these these terms t

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:51.319
ox and epsilon into a single term C ox

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:53.329
or the in other words we're going to say

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:56.089
that the total capacitance is equal to C

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:59.990
ox times the area of the transistor or

00:09:56.089 --> 00:10:01.579
the so C ox is a capacitance density if

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:05.750
you will it's the capacitance per unit

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:08.300
area of the device so if we cancel out L

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:16.010
we make that substitution we get our

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:19.459
formula W times C ox times mu e times V

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:22.149
G C minus VT and we're starting to get

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:26.149
closer see we've got a W we've got a mu

00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:28.130
we've got a C ox we we still have this e

00:10:26.149 --> 00:10:30.589
which we will want to get rid of and

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.560
we've got this awkward VGC because we we

00:10:30.589 --> 00:10:35.300
don't know what VC is we don't the

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.510
channel isn't a terminal of the

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.760
transistor so let's let's see what else

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.130
we can do to this equation

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:45.860
well how about let's just attack this

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:49.399
first one e so what is the electric

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:51.290
field in the in the channel in terms of

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:55.370
what we know well if we go back to our

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:58.579
transistor we know that there's a source

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:00.410
on this side there's a drain on this

00:10:58.579 --> 00:11:02.510
side or we can flip the sides if you

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:05.019
prefer and there's some voltage between

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.019
the two

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:11.720
VDS and we know just from basic

00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:15.259
electromagnetics that the electric field

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.360
between two points in space if

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:20.000
everything is homogeneous and everything

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.759
works out everything works out nicely is

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.209
just equal to the voltage divided by the

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:28.069
distance between them which here is the

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:29.839
transistor length so we're assuming that

00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:32.839
these wells are all at the same

00:11:29.839 --> 00:11:36.079
potential well okay we can we can make

00:11:32.839 --> 00:11:40.519
that substitution and then we get mu

00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:43.069
times C ox times W and now we have the

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:47.000
over L that we were expecting which is

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:51.290
from our electric field times VD s times

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.970
VGC minus VT and we're almost done the

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:59.930
the only thing left is VG C so how do we

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:04.990
how do we figure out what VG c is well

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:08.600
if we look at our MOSFET again this is

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:11.990
VC so we've got a we've got a certain

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:15.620
gate voltage that we apply right VG and

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:18.649
we've got a channel voltage here VC and

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.660
then we also know there's a source

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:23.750
voltage here V s and a drain voltage

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:26.839
here V D and you know if we just make

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:29.660
some some somewhat sketchy arguments

00:12:26.839 --> 00:12:32.449
like say pretend there's two resistors

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:35.779
here and there's some current flowing

00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:38.029
through this eye then we know that VC is

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:39.920
and let's say these resistors are the

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:42.410
same value and this is you know fairly

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.560
realistic because the material itself is

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:47.449
going to have a resistance so we we know

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.300
that this point VC has to be the

00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:55.730
midpoint between V s and VD that's just

00:12:50.300 --> 00:13:01.699
a basic voltage divider so we can

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:06.079
rewrite VC VC is just V s plus VD over

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:08.449
du or it's the midpoint and now we just

00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:11.480
need to perform some algebraic wizardry

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:14.000
which all all that ever amounts to in

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.459
engineering is subtracting or adding one

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.630
or subtracting or adding a zero from an

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:19.700
equation so

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:23.330
we're gonna say VC is equal to vs over

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:26.270
two plus VD over two and then we're

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.830
going to add zero and the reason we're

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.290
gonna add zero is so we can rearrange

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:33.380
this equation make it nice and pretty

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:35.860
we're going to add V s over 2 minus 3 s

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.860
over 2

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:43.760
ok so rewriting the full equation this

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:49.610
is this is going to be our almost our

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:53.450
final form IDs is equal to MU n and this

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:58.250
so this is mu of the electrons see ox W

00:13:53.450 --> 00:14:03.800
over L times when we had a VD s and then

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:08.630
VG C which is VG minus VC which is V s

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:14.270
over 2 plus V s over 2 that's BS VD over

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:21.080
2 so plus VD over 2 and then there was

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:23.120
another minus V s over 2 and then minus

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:27.380
the threshold voltage VT I might have

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:29.840
forgotten that up there as well okay so

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.590
all we need to do is group things and

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:38.600
rearrange them so mu n SI ox W over L

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:42.980
times VD s times VG minus V s which is

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:47.480
just VG s plus one half and now we're

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:52.370
going to group this VD and this V s plus

00:14:47.480 --> 00:15:00.740
1/2 V SD or we can rewrite that as minus

00:14:52.370 --> 00:15:03.530
1/2 VD s minus 1/2 VD s minus VT and

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:06.050
then all we need to do is factor this VD

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.570
s into all these terms and we're done

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.450
and we have our final equation for a

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:18.620
MOSFET which is the drain current mu n

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:25.430
si ox W over L times vgs minus VT times

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:27.290
VDS minus 1/2 VDS squared and so that's

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:29.330
sort of where the equation comes from

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.580
that's the that's the derivation for it

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.860
I hope you found this video interesting

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.270
and hopefully not too mathematical and

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.670
we're kind of able to follow along with

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:40.730
what we're doing I strongly suggest that

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.680
you you try to do this yourself because

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.050
the thinking process behind it is the

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.540
same thinking process behind basically

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:49.690
all of engineering so hope you enjoyed

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.690
it
