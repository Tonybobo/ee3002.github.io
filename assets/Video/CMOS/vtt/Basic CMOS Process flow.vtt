00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.660
this is chemical processes for micro and
nanofabrication on Chris Mac and this is

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.440
lecture 9 CMOS process flow a reading
for this lecture is chapter 16 of our

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.990
textbook by Campbell fabrication
engineering at the micro and nano scale

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.150
our topic today we're going to go
through a very basic very simplified

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.269
version of the typical CMOS process flow
here our emphasis will be on looking at

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.399
how the different process steps tie
together to make a CMOS circuit we won't

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.710
cover everything today there's lots and
lots of steps that we won't even mention

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.450
but we'll cover the basics the the most
important steps and see the order that

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.289
they're done in and what kind of
structures result because of that and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.739
then when we go through the individual
process steps in detail when we talk

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.710
about oxidation and deposition and etch
etc we'll have a bit of more context for

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.899
how they fit so let's go through some of
these basic typical process steps first

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.640
I'll call it step 0 wafer preparation
we're gonna laser scribe the back of the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
wafer to put a unique ID number
sometimes a barcode on those wafers

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
we're going to clean the wafers we're
going to do gettering that's where we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.909
implant big imperfections into the back
of the wafer that will then attract

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.820
other defects to them and away from the
surface where we're going to have our

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.310
devices and we'll do zeroth layer
alignment marks that the rest of the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.590
circuitry will be aligned to as we build
up our patterns step 1

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.159
and sometimes the order of these steps
aren't exactly the same depending on the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.409
type of process you're doing the step 1
is will create n Wells and P wells

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.790
sometimes we use the wafer and it's
doping instead of one of these wells but

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.659
today it's much more common to have both
an N well and a P well these form the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.280
regions of the wafer where we're going
to create our devices and we'll get the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
doping that we want for those devices in
these wells then we'll create the active

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.330
area this is defines the regions of the
wafer that are going to be isolated with

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.060
a thick
oxidation and those regions that are

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.170
active that is where our transistor is
going to be so every transistor is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.849
surrounded by an oxide insulator to
isolate it then and will form our poly

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.970
silicon gate the gate of our gate source
drain MOS transistor and we'll do some

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.680
engineering of the the structures of
that gate something called a lightly

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.750
doped drain where we put sidewall
spacers on the gate and do a little bit

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.870
of doping then we'll do our main source
drain implant and diffusion to create

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.220
the source in the drain now we've
actually built a transistor from here on

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.720
out we're gonna connect up the
transistors to make a circuit so we're

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.860
gonna form Southside and contact holes
which is where we're gonna make our

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.200
contacts to the source in the drain and
a gate so that we can make electrical

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.730
contact and wire up our transistors
we'll use tungsten plugs to fill up

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.100
these contact holes and then a level of
metallization to run wires to connect

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.889
the transistors together but one level
of metallization is generally not enough

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:33.540
we need to have additional metal layers
often two four six high as ten layers of

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.470
metal to run all the different wires
that are required to connect to all of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.389
these transistors millions even billions
of transistors together and finally

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.169
we'll put a passivation layer over the
top and open up that passivation

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.870
passivation layer for bonding pads when
we package the chip and communicate with

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.169
the outside world that's the basic flow
let's look at some pictures of some of

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:04.709
the main steps described here not all of
them and see how it works so to begin

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.819
we're gonna make our wet Wells I'm only
going to show you the n well here and

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.370
this very simplified process will assume
that the P substrate the P doped

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.160
substrate will be used for
the n-channel device without having to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.139
have a p well but generally we would
have a p well

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.230
so we'll form an oxide layer on top of
the wafer we'll open up that oxide layer

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.290
by doing a patterning step lithography
plus hatch and then the open area this

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:41.340
area right here that is not protected by
oxide will implant a dopant and then

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.660
diffuse it in this will be phosphorus in
this case which is an n-type dopant and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.639
will create this n-well of doped region
the oxide serves as a barrier so the

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.960
implant dopant lands inside the oxide it
doesn't get into the substrate and also

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.800
it's a diffusion barrier this dopant
doesn't diffuse very well in oxide so no

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.240
the dopant makes it into the substrate
underneath the oxide only in the open

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.540
area do we get our n-type dopant and now
we've got an

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.950
n-well in which we're going to form our
p-channel device then we're going to

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.300
create our active areas what we mean by
creating an active area is we're going

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.330
to grow oxide in the regions where we
don't want a transistor in this oxide

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.320
will act as an isolation between the
various active areas so I'm not going

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.280
through all the steps required here but
we'll form a pattern and photoresist

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.490
which will then transfer usually into a
nitride layer which then blocks the

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.419
formation of an oxide layer here here
and here everyone that's everywhere

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.880
that's not being protected forms an
isolation area this is a process called

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.010
local oxidation of silicon there's
also another more important process

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.280
today called shallow trench isolation
they form the same they have the same

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.660
function they create isolation regions
between the active areas and these

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.240
active areas become the areas where
we're gonna build our transistor the

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.440
poly gate formation we first grow a thin
oxide or deposit a thin oxide over our

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.920
active areas here and here and we
pattern deposit poly silicon and pattern

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:38.420
into the poly silicon gate so this gate
region will be the gate of our CMOS our

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.580
MOS transistor notice that we have one
on each side over the end well we're

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.600
going to form a p-channel device and
over the substrate in this case or it

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.310
could be a P well we're gonna form an
n-channel device so now we're going to

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.550
do our doping for our source and drain
we have to do it in two steps because

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.690
we're forming both a p-channel device
and an n-channel device for the

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:10.790
n-channel device we need to chip deposit
donors n type dopants into the source

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:18.560
in the drain region so we're going to
use arsenic for our dopant we cover up

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:25.100
with photoresist all those regions where
we don't want the arsenic dopant to

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.840
go so the dopant lands inside the
photoresist and is blocked it's not able

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.010
to get into the substrate but here in
this this region of the source and the

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:40.400
drain we we form our dopants and diffuse
them into the substrate notice that the

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:45.460
gate also acts as a block to prevent
dopants from getting underneath the gate

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.660
so we call this a self-aligned gate
process because the source and drain are

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:56.570
self aligned to the gate by nature of
the fact that the gate blocks the dopant

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.580
since this is an n-type dopant we form
our source and drain and implanted

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:10.700
regions we then cover up the n-channel
device and we open up a region where our

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:16.610
p-channel device is going to be made and
we apply a P dopant boron in this case

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:24.830
to create the source and drain inside of
the N well now we've got the source and

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.630
drain and the gate all made up for both
types of devices the P well and the

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:35.390
n-well device the P channel in the n
well and the n channel in this case

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:41.090
the P substrate we're going to make
contact holes generally we would form a

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:48.780
a Southside
a compound of that improves the contact

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.800
resistance then will deposit oxide over
everything as shown here after we've

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.910
created the Southside layer which is not
shown in this figure from the oxide do

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.890
lithography step to put holes in this
oxide so now we have contact holes to

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:10.380
make contact with the source in the
drain of both devices also not shown

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.340
because it be in the back into the
screen or out of the screen and the

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.900
three-dimensional view will be contact
holes making contact to the gates as

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:25.170
well we're gonna fill these contact
holes up with the metallization here I

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:32.130
show kind of an older process where
we're going to fill it up with an

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:36.750
aluminum interconnect a more modern
process today would fill up these

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:42.900
contact holes with a tungsten plug and
then use copper to interconnect or wire

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:49.770
up the transistors well this is a
cross-sectional view let's see what that

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.750
looks like top down as well so here I
repeat that cross sectional view with

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.520
the two transistors the end channel and
the P channel next to each other with

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.430
contacts wired up and then here's a
top-down view so our cross section is

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.690
cutting right through this middle region
here right through here

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.830
so we have an end well formed in this
dotted line and then we have our

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:19.530
diffusion regions the active area is
formed here and here in pink and yellow

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:25.140
for the two different devices our gate
is shown in the green going across so

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.600
whenever I have a diffusion region or an
active area where I'm gonna implant my

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.080
source and drain with a gate crossing it
that's a transistor a gate crossing an

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.100
active area forms a transistor because
well the source and drain on either side

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.480
and the gate and now else we have to do
is make contact to each of those so I

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.700
have a metal line making a contact to
the source and metal I'm making contact

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.190
to the drain and another metal line
making contact to the gate now how these

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:59.840
things get connected up depends on the
specifics of the circuit here I show

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:05.930
these two gates connected together maybe
I'm making an inverter using these

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:16.250
complementary MOS transistors well this
is up to the first level of metal but we

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.230
need more levels of metal to connect all
of the transistors together the

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:27.920
highest-end logic devices today might
have 10 layers of metal here's a picture

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.020
from that I got from IBM 2005
it shows copper wiring so these are

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.160
copper wires and it's kind of cut in two
cross sections so you can see two sides

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.070
of it
the transistors are way down here at the

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:44.210
surface of the silicon and then these
are the copper interconnects in the

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.330
first layer the second layer the third
layer the fourth layer the fifth layer

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:53.060
the sixth layer etc and then we have
these interconnections that connect one

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.650
layer to the next all the way up so
here's a layer of metal here's a layer

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.330
of metal and then in between we have
some some vias that are filled with

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.440
copper to make a connection from the
last layer to this layer and finally

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.190
over the top we have a passivation layer
that covers the whole chip except for

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:17.570
the regions where we need to do bonding
to in our package well that is a very

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.220
very brief description of the major
steps we're going to spend a lot of time

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.820
this semester going through each of the
individual process steps in some detail

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.470
but at least now you have a picture of
how they all fit together to form a

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.990
seamless device and a circuit so what
have we learned in lecture 9 you should

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.209
be able to list the basic steps in the
CMOS process flow now the numbering is

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:45.770
not unique just arbitrary the numbers
that I pick you don't worry about what

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:54.080
is number six or number four but the
basic steps in the order that they go in

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.450
you should be able to know and finally
you should be able to find the

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:03.529
transistor if you're looking at a
top-down design view look for the gates

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:07.130
and the active areas you should be able
to point to where the transistors are in

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.700
that design
well that's lecture 9 beginning next

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.260
time we're going to begin our unit
process steps will begin with oxidation

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.120
and go through the different unit
processing steps and look at them in

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.490
some detail thanks and see you then
