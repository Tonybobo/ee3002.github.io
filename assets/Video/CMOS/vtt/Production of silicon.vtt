00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.490
silicon is a semiconductor and its main
applications fall into three categories

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.410
first solar cells and components in
electronics like for example your mobile

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.720
telephone and your computer in this
group one utilizes the semiconducting

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.320
properties of silicon the next category
is aluminium alloys silicon is added as

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.690
an alloying element to aluminium to
enhance the properties of the alloy the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.420
last category is the increasing use of
silicon to produce silicones silicones

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.929
have numerous uses from baking products
to stickers

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:52.539
the Earth's crust comprises 28% silicon
and 47% oxygen by weight there is a

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.339
large abundance of silicon and the
Earth's crust consists mainly of oxides

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.940
such as silicon dioxide if one wants to
produce elemental silicon one needs

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.920
however quite pure silicon dioxide
sources and hence most producers of

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.649
silicon import silicon dioxide the
silicon produced directly from silicon

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.720
dioxide is known as metallurgical grade
silicon and the pure silicon dioxide

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.500
material is called quartz to produce
metallurgical grade silicon one needs

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.659
quartz the raw material that contains
silicon and coal to remove the oxygen

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.159
from the quartz and wood chips to
maintain good permeability in the

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.330
furnace for the gas to escape
silicon is produced in large industrial

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.090
furnaces the production process requires
large amounts of energy 10 to 12

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.409
megawatt hours of the ton of silicon
produce as well as utilizing high

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.890
temperatures up to 2,000 degrees C and
the lower part of the fence the electric

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.240
energy is supplied by a three large
carbon electrodes that are submerged

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.580
into the raw materials the electrodes
will gradually be consumed and therefore

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.780
new electrode elements are added by
screwing them to the top of the furnace

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.780
electrodes the quartz carbon and wood
chips are added from silos at the top of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.760
the furnace as the materials are
conveyed through the furnace the oxygen

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
is removed from the quartz and liquid
silicon is tapped from the lower part of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.110
the furnace at high temperatures the
liquid silicon is tapped into laters

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.590
where small parts of aluminium and
calcium are reduced

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.849
after this refining process the liquid
silicon is cast into beds to solidify

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:54.069
the solidified silicon is then crushed
and shipped to the customer

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.090
the simplified equation of the silicon
production process shows silicon dioxide

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.020
reacting with carbon to produce silicon
which will be tapped from the furnace

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.080
and carbon monoxide gas that will ascend
through the materials in the furnace

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.600
there are however two important species
that will also be present in the furnace

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.110
silicon carbide and silicon monoxide gas
if we focus on the area around one of

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.970
the electrodes we can see the major
zones in a furnace in the lower part of

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.260
the furnace the temperature is about
2,000 degrees C with the energy being

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.610
produced by the arcs from the electrode
to the liquid silicon at the bottom of

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.040
the furnace or to the silicon carbide
crust that has formed in the arc itself

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.870
the temperature is much higher the arc
is produced because there is a cavity

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.250
around the electrode tip which is filled
with silicon monoxide and carbon

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:58.030
monoxide gas as one goes up the furnace
the temperature decreases and a mixture

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.670
of melted silicon dioxide and silicon
carbide is over the cavity Bickford

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.280
silicon is very viscous and the material
mix will not flow down naturally as a

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.000
result the cavity roof is formed this is
a very simplified picture and during

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.160
industrial excavations many different
zones and geometries have been found

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.720
however the common picture is the
presence of the cavity alpha silicon

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.140
carbide built up in the burner
and parley transformed broad materials

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.300
in the top part of the furnace the
temperature on top of the raw materials

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.320
is approximately 1,000 degrees C the
most important reaction in the so-called

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.870
low temperature zone is the reaction
between carbon and the ascending silicon

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.980
dioxide gas as a production of silicon
monoxide gas consumes a lot of energy

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.370
the energy consumption will have a
strong correlation with the silicon

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.490
monoxide lost out of the thirst the main
role of the carbon added will hence be

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:12.800
to capture the silicon dioxide gas
before it leaves the furnace

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.650
the brown condensate will agglomerate
the quartz the silicon carbide particles

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.680
are shown in the picture micrographs of
this brown condensate shows that this

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.570
silicon embedded in a silicon dioxide
nature

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.950
when this condensate is heated as it
descends with the raw materials the

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.630
silicon will accumulate into larger
silicon drops and then finally at high

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.040
enough temperatures where both silicon
dioxide and silicon is melted the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.350
silicon will flow out of the silicon
dioxide matrix as the condensates

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.880
prevent the materials done down in the
furnace the materials are mechanically

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.990
pushed down with a stoking machine some
silicon can also be produced in the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.970
silicon carbide particles higher up in
the furnace according to the reaction as

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:17.020
shown in my craft from a pilot scale
furnace experiment as the carbon

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.000
monoxide the remaining silicon monoxide
gas are leaving the furnace they will

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.950
combine with air at the top of the face
the carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:33.550
gases will oxidize into carbon dioxide
gas and silicon dioxide micro particles

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.800
called micro silica
micro silica is an important by-product

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.460
and is typically used as filler in
concrete and to produce refractories to

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.570
summarize the metallurgical silicon
production the raw materials added to

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.900
the furnace are silicon dioxide and
carbon materials wood chips are added to

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.520
increase the permeability of the
materials to facilitate gas flow the

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.720
materials are added to the furnace
at approximately 1,000 degrees C and

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.020
will be gradually heated to 2,000
degrees C the liquid silicon will be

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.520
tapped at the lower part of the furnace
into ladles where the trace elements of

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.890
aluminium and calcium will be further
reduce the liquid silicon will then be

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:28.460
cast solidified crushed and shipped to
customers the micro silica will be

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.170
separated from the off gas in filter
bags and the remaining hot off gas may

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:40.370
be processed via an energy recovery unit
to produce electrical energy as Norway

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.260
has a large amount of renewable
electrical energy from hydropower there

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:53.260
are several plants producing silicon and
ferrosilicon like L chem Warka and fin
