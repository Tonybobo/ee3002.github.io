00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.529
let us discuss MOSFET in detail

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:16.619
MOSFET is an electronic device most

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.919
widely used in ICs it has three

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.919
terminals named as source drain and gate

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.119
construction of basic design of MOSFET

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.570
is quite simple just take a block of

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.470
p-type semiconductor this block will be

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.309
your base for MOSFET we also call it as

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.239
substrate and the entire MOSFET we will

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.250
fabricate on this base now two portions

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.250
on the same side of this p-type

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.430
substrate are made highly doped with

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:58.120
n-type impurity as these are shown here

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.160
in the figure source and drain terminals

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.510
are brought out from these two end

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.510
regions as shown

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.820
now the entire surface of the substrate

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.200
is coated with a layer of silicon

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.920
dioxide silicon dioxide will behave here

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.450
as insulation on this layer of silicon

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.580
dioxide a thin metallic plate is placed

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.850
this metallic plate will act as gauge

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.860
contact to the substrate the gate

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.990
terminal is brought out from this

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.670
metallic plate

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.429
hence it is seen from the figure that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.700
gate contact is insulated from the

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.070
substrate but drain and source contacts

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.720
are directly connected to respective

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.110
n-type regions

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.200
this was the constructional feature of a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.300
buzz FET now we will come to the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.300
operational features of MOSFET

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.329
for that we have to connect on DC

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.929
voltage source between these two n-type

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.929
regions

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.060
you

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.260
the n-type region connected with

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.530
positive terminal of the source is

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.690
called as drain and the N region

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.950
connected with negative terminal of the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.840
source is called as source as soon as

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.590
the drain and source are connected with

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.890
DC voltage source there will be two PN

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.560
junctions formed one is in between

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.560
n-type drain and p-type base

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.310
and the other is in between P type base

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.069
and n type source as drain is connected

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.620
with positive terminal of the source the

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.280
drain is in higher voltage than base

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.270
hence this PN Junction is reverse biased

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.540
on the other hand as source is connected

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.030
with negative terminal of the battery P

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.860
type base will be at higher potential

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.580
than n type source

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.989
hence this PN Junction is forward biased

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.110
as between drain and source there will

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.959
be one reverse biased and one forward

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.150
biased Junction there will be no

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.390
significant current flowing from the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.510
drain to source but a tiny current

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.080
continues to flow due to minority

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.840
carriers we can say that virtually there

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.100
is no continuous path or channel between

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.100
drain and source

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.379
now let us see what happens if one

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:01.000
suitable positive voltage is applied at

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.000
gate terminal of the device

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.860
in that case due to attraction a

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.080
positive potential of gate contact plate

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.790
negative free electrons that is minority

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.790
carriers in p-type base

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.350
we'll be accumulated towards a contact

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.820
plate and form a channel of negative

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.820
charge carriers even inside p-type

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.820
semiconductor

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.810
this channel due to higher concentration

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.960
of free electrons will behave as n-type

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.259
semiconductor

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.599
although entire base is doped with P

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:58.819
type or trivalent impurity it is obvious

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.870
that the number of free electrons

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.340
accumulated towards gate contact plate

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.830
depends on the strength a positive

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.969
potential given to the gate terminal

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.599
hence width of n channel depends on the

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:17.659
voltage applied at gate terminal more

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.969
the applied voltage greater the width of

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.810
the channel means greater the

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.370
conductance between drain and source

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.650
here we have seen that there is no

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.379
direct connection between gauge contact

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.139
and substrate instead these are

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.289
insulated from each other but due to

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.330
electrostatic attraction the conducting

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.210
channel between drain and source is

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.599
formed and because of that the channel

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.539
is also called induced shadow and the

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:51.469
device is called induced channel MOSFET

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.330
it is also clear that when there is no

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:56.120
voltage applied to the gate of the

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.449
device there will be no current from

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.300
drain to source except negligible amount

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:06.800
of saturation current due to minority

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.620
carriers but if the gate voltage is

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.439
gradually increased by keeping fixed

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.469
drain to source voltage after certain

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:19.000
minimum applied gate voltage drain to

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.000
source current will start flowing

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.510
and this voltage is called threshold

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.510
voltage

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:41.280
so below threshold voltage the device

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.640
will behave as non conducting or in off

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.640
board

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.819
and for gate voltage greater than

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:53.830
threshold value the device will be in

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:53.830
conducting or on mode

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:03.370
so this type of MOSFET is suitably used

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.370
as a gate control switching device

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.030
thank you
