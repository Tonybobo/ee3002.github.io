00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.810
welcome. In this video we
will look at the differences between

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.080
rising and falling edge triggered
flip-flops and how they are constructed

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.090
so first let's start with the the
symbols for the two flip-flops so for

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.240
the rising edge flip-flop so you have
the D in this input and you have Q out

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.130
as an output and clock is the input and
the symbol looks like this and for the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:46.110
falling edge triggered flip-flop you
will have D in and Qout the same inputs

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210
and outputs but at the clock you will
still have clock coming in but there is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.579
a bubble at the input the symbol usually
shows like this and you have a clock

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.070
coming in so this is the falling edge
this is the rising edge triggered

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.430
flip-flop and this is the falling edge
triggered flip-flop so now for the input

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.189
stimulus how the respond let's look at
that one so let me draw a clock signal

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.759
something like this and then let me draw
a D input

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.000
something like this so this is Clock and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:54.909
this is D in now let's look at the
output for a rising edge triggered

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.920
flip-flop so a rising edge triggered
flip-flop looks at the rising edges of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.679
the clock so let's assume that data the
Q out was high initially so it looks

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.060
at this rising edge sees that Din is low
so it goes low and at this rising edge

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.700
it seems D in is high so it goes high and
then at the next rising edge it sees D in

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:34.000
is still high so it remains high so this
is the rising edge D out this is the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.950
output of the rising edge triggered
flip-flop D out so now let's look at the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.859
falling edge triggered flip-flop so it
will look at the falling edges here so

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:54.730
now assume that the the D out started at
high again so at the falling edge it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.709
goes low of the clock and then the next
falling edge it sees that D in is still

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.000
low so it remains low so this is the
output of the falling edge triggered

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.609
that's the Q out so I should say Q out
here too it's a mistake so so now how do

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.950
these flip-flops differ in construction
so we know we have seen that the

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.799
flip-flop is constructed using two
latches so we have the two latches so

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:37.950
let me draw this the first latch

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:48.629
it's connected to the second latch in
series and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:02.270
now we saw that for the rising edge
triggered flip-flop so this latch is

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.400
clear this switch is closed when clock
is high clock is high and these are

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:20.269
closed when clock is low clock is low so
this is for the rising edge triggered

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.360
flip-flop so now for the falling edge to
make it a falling edge triggered

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:35.590
flip-flop what we just have to do is we
said that these are switches s 1 s 2 s 1

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:48.110
Prime and s 2 Prime and for the rising
edge s 1 and s 2 prime are closed when

00:04:48.110 --> 00:05:05.840
clock is low and s 2 and s 1 prime are
closed when clock is high and this is

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.380
for the rising edge triggered flip-flop
now to make it a falling edge triggered

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.640
flip-flop what we just have to do is we
just have to invert the function of the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:26.510
switches so we need to make sure that s
1 and s 2 prime are closed when clock is

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:36.110
low or when clock is high this time so
when clock is high you should close s s

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:50.240
2 Prime and s 1 and when clock is low we
close s 2 and s 1 Prime so what

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.479
we did was we made this clock here and
right in green here clock and clock

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:03.169
bar to control these switches and this
will be controlled by a clock the switch

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:11.300
and then
to be controlled by clock bar so once we

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:18.640
do this we can change it to a falling
edge triggered flip-flop
