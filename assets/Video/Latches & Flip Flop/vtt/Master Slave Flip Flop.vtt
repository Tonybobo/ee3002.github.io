00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.500
welcome to our tutorial on digital
electronics and in this tutorial I'm

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.510
going to discuss about the master/slave
flip-flops

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.670
okay so before the advent of the you
know the edge triggered flip-flops the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.619
master-slave flip-flop was widely used
in order to protect the output from

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.500
sudden changes in the input all right so
this problem has plagued the flip-flop

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.200
community for a very long time and
probably the master slave configuration

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.739
I mean behind the development of the
master slave configuration the basic

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.730
idea was that you can keep the outputs
stable by introducing a known time delay

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.110
denoted by Td equal to that of one
clock pulse okay so if you would in turn

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.539
or anyone constructing a flip-flop
circuit would you know incorporate a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.830
delay time off about one clock pulse
then in that case the flip-flop

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.799
configuration would be stable to certain
changes in the input okay that required

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.990
time to stabilize so if these are the
two SR flip-flop diagrams that I am

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.729
showing you over here okay so this is
the Q and the Q bar alright and here's the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.159
clock okay and on the other hand over
here we have the q 1 and the q 1 bar

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.770
okay so this is the s 1 and s sorry R 1
inputs and from the clock of this

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.759
flip-flop we connect a not gate and take
it to the clock over here for the next

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.619
flip-flop so this is clock 2 and clock 1
in this case so this is flip-flop 1 and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:01.920
this is flip-flop 2 so basically what we
see here is we can just see two SR

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.509
flip-flops being connected this way so
you'll probably might be wondering what

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.750
am i doing
rather what is the meaning of all this

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.580
okay so this thing that y'all are seeing
right here okay the way that I have

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.870
connected these two SR flip-flops right
over here gives us the master slave

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.680
configuration okay so this as you can
see here is the master slave

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.959
configuration of the flip-flops
okay so therefore all master slave

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.750
flip-flops have been you know obtained
from the master slave SR flip-flop or

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.860
rather derived from the master slave SR
flip-flop that was first formed in

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.600
somewhat this way okay so how is this
master slave flip-flop superior okay all

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.770
right I'll come to it with the help of
an example let's say I give you the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.640
truth table over here okay there you go
Q 1 and Q1 bar okay so let's say that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.520
the presence of the clock input we have
s equal to 0 and R equal to 1 so let's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.250
say over here we have a 0 and a 1 and
the presence of the clock input so let's

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.410
say this clock is on for about a period
of one second so now this input would

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.040
cause you know an output over here at
the flip-flop 1 as 0 and 1 which is the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.470
same sort of to that we would have
obtained for an SR flip-flop okay so now

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.540
till the moment that there is the clock
input I mean the clock input at the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:47.709
flip-flop one is at the logic one level
the inputs are subjected to change which

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.650
would affect the output as well so here
if this flip-flop is connected in a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.299
circuit which you know suffers from the
problem or rather in case of certain

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.670
switching applications where these
switch you know these switch signals I

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.670
mean the signals coming from the
switches you know sometimes you know

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.510
subject to sudden changes ok sudden
unprecedented and you know changes over

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.109
here due to certain fluctuations or
certain faults so then this input over

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.250
here during this
time when the clock is at logic one

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.320
level would experience the changes and
the outputs over here would change

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.199
accordingly so in cases where the inputs
you know take some time to stabilize

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:42.560
okay the output also keeps on varying
for that period of time till the moment

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.229
the inputs remain you know fluctuating
okay so during the period when the clock

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:55.010
signal is at the logic one level the
output is subject to change under the

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.370
change of the input signal okay so in
this configuration what happens is that

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.449
this configuration was basically
designed to avoid the state or rather

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.500
avoid the condition of logic race okay
so when the input you know just is

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.120
subject to you know rapid changes and
the output is not I mean output is also

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.190
changing accordingly that condition is
termed as the logic race condition okay

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.099
so during this condition what happens is
that if we just take these outputs as

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.590
the ultimate ones then it will just be
changing within the clock period so now

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.039
as soon as the clock ends the clock one
becomes inactive okay I mean the

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:46.400
flip-flop one output is not subject to
change anymore with changes occurring at

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.650
its input terminal so now these outputs
from flip-flop 1 travel into the input

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:59.180
of the flip-flop 2 where the act has
input signals okay and now here by

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.860
connecting a not gate whenever the clock
at flip-flop one falls from the logic

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.470
one to the logic zero level it just goes
to the not gate and appears at the clock

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.320
two of flip-flop two as a logic 1 signal
thereby activating its clock okay I mean

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.180
the activating the clock of flip flop 2 so
during this case the inputs to this

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:26.539
flip-flopping zero and one at is 1 and R
1 respectively the outputs change to 0

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.980
and 1 respectively so what we have here
is that during

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.860
second phase when the clock signal at
flip-flop one comes to logic zero level

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.810
flip-flop two gets activated and over
there since flip-flop one stores the

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:50.970
final state of its output the inputs to
flip-flop 2 is not subject to any kind

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.740
of variation it remains constant and
hence the output finally remains

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.600
constant so this is basically the
benefit of the master slave

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:07.050
configuration where we can you know
maintain the output state you know

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.640
stable with respect even I mean even
there are certain changes

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:17.580
I mean unprecedented and sudden changes
in the input terminals okay so having

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.270
said that if you just move on to the
truth table again so we'll see that by

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:28.230
applying certain input combinations over
here we obtain the results at the output

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.250
okay
similar to that as we would see before a

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.160
you know SR flip-flop so here by in this
state there is no change okay so there's

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.520
no change right here alright and by
putting logic one signals on both the s

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:50.310
and r inputs here in the Q and Q Bar I
mean they would just suffer the invalid

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.690
state okay so they'll enter the invalid
state over here so there you go

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.540
so this is the invalid state finally
so this is basically the circuit diagram

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:06.690
of the logic I mean master slave SR
flip-flop so where this flip-flop one

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:16.050
part is the master okay and flip flop 2
acts as the slave the slave follows the

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.300
master as the slave you know as you can
see here outputs the same thing or

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.740
rather takes an input the same thing as
is outputted by the master and you know

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:33.090
outputs the same as what the master had
when the clock signal just ended okay so

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.050
the basic benefit is that into the
output remains stable and subject to no

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:42.450
sudden changes in the input okay so if I
were just you know try and show you the

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.089
logic
of the SR flip-flop I mean SR

00:08:46.089 --> 00:08:51.339
master-slave flip-flop then it would
look somewhat like this as you can see

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:56.700
here
okay this is a Q Q bar alright so this

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:04.029
sign that's given over here this one
represents the master slave flip-flops

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:10.540
okay and if we just you know modify the
master slave SR flip-flop okay let me

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:19.089
just write it down so this is the master
slave SR flip-flop okay so if I just you

00:09:19.089 --> 00:09:24.839
know modify this diagram into something
like this okay so there's Q and Q Bar

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:30.970
okay it's a master slave configuration
alright S and R here is the clock but if we

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:36.790
just connect a not gate from the
S input to the R input then it becomes

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:43.300
a master slave D flip-flop so this is
basically the master slave D flip-flop

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:50.824
okay whose logic diagram can be finally
given as something like this okay

00:09:50.824 --> 00:09:57.730
here is Q Q bar okay and the here is
a D input terminal with the clock all

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.320
right so this is basically I mean this
modification over here is basically the

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.880
same as you know connecting or rather
I'd use a different color in this case

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:16.540
just by connecting a not gate right over
here from the s input to r input

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:24.220
over here as you can see okay so there
you go so this is how we would obtain or

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:29.529
rather I mean this thing I think is not
visible much so yeah that's the

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:33.790
modification I was talking about so
having said that if we just you know

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.010
quickly move on to the truth table of
the D flip-flop it would look something

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:46.149
like this so here it is the D input the
clock input and the Q and Q Bar inputs

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:54.040
okay so when we have a zero at D input
under the presence of the clock signal Q

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.620
is set to 0 Q Bar set to 1
and at you know logic one input at D

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.690
input terminal under the presence of the
clock we have a logic one signal at Q

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:09.390
and 0  at Q bar respectively
okay so having said that I would just

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:14.730
finally come on to the most popularly
used master slave flip-flop

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:21.600
that's it master slave JK flip-flop okay
so here we go the master slave J K

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.570
flip-flop okay so here would be the
circuit diagram of the master slave JK

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:33.840
flip-flop I think you're probably you
know curious to see this okay so there

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.860
we go so here are the feedback ports okay
or this flip-flop and there's two more

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:49.950
NAND gates as you can see okay so they
just go into the input or rather connect

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:56.220
to the output of two more NAND gates
right over here and they also go and

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.670
connect to the inputs of two more NAND
gates

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:06.810
right over here okay and here we have a
clock input of the second flip-flop so

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.840
this is flip flop 2 okay and here or
rather I would not call it flip flop 2

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.920
because that would be you know highly
inaccurate okay and here we would have

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:23.790
another as you see feedback path to
these terminals and over here we would

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:30.960
have the preset and the clear terminals
rather clear inputs okay

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.580
and then finally from these two
terminals we would have special input

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:42.870
terminals okay  I mean carrying
the Q and Q Bar stages okay coming into

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:48.840
and falling into the first gate which
receives the inputs that is here we have

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:55.590
the input J and K
and now over here this is the common

00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:01.560
terminal connecting these two gates okay
where we apply the clock all right so

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.260
this is basically the circuit of a JK
flip-flop in the master slave

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.450
configuration
this is basically the master/slave JK

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:17.120
flip-flop okay master set configuration
where you can see in this circuit that

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.770
we have two more inputs as you can see
the preset and the clear it's given

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:28.130
because whenever a flip-flop is applied
power to okay there is no guarantee as

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.330
to what state it would you know result
in at the outputs okay

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:38.000
it means stay in any state possible so
in order to set the flip-flop to the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.920
logic one state are yeah but we not have
said the output of the flip-flop the

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.850
logic one state we use the preset input
okay we apply the logic zeroes your

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.950
signal over here in order to set the
flip-flop output state at logic one and

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.810
if we are going to give okay it clear
over here okay

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.370
this is also a active low say input
signal so if you're going to apply a

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.770
logic 0 signal at clear then we're going
to set the flip-flop output to logic 0

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.990
okay that's our description as to which
state we want to set the flip-flop 2 ok

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:22.610
so having said that I would just give
you the JK flip-flops you know the truth

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:27.680
table ok so here you go
so whenever we have the clock ok so J is

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:34.580
1 K is 0 we have this sort of results
right over here as you can see under the

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.900
presence of the clock in all the
conditions ok and finally when we have

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.620
both ones on it
this thing just toggles okay so as you

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:50.150
can see it will change again so there it
is the toggle state so basically we

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:56.630
come almost to the end of our tutorial
where I just want to show you the logic

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:04.370
diagram of the JK master slave flip-flop
ok denote it somewhat in this fashion

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.740
alright that's the JK flip-flop with the
clock so this is basically the logic

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:15.620
diagram of the master slave JK flip-flop
ok and with that we come to the end of

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.960
our discussion in this tutorial on the
master slave flip-flop country

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.830
relations and the various types of
master slave  flip-flops as you can see so

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:30.260
kindly check out our next tutorial on
digital electronics and till then it's

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.750
just goodbye for now and thank you
