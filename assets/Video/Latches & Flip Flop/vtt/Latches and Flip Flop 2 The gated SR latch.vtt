00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:09.450
a gated set/reset latch is an SR latch
that can only change state while it's

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.089
enabled for example imagine an air
conditioning system in a building each

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
room could have its own cooling unit
controlled independently by its own SR

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.119
latch the set and reset signals might
come from a temperature sensor or a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.080
humidity sensor in the room if these
were gated SR latches then a central

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.219
control panel could be used to enable or
disable the switching on and off of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.710
these units on a room-by-room basis

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.309
here's an Un-gated SR latch remember an
SR latch built from nor gates like this

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.879
one is an active high SR latch this
means it requires a high pulse that's a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.640
1 to be applied at input s in order to
get a high output at Q in other words to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.090
set the latch alternatively to reset the
latch and make the output at Q zero it

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.409
requires a high pulse to be applied to
input arm it's invalid for both s and R

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.270
to be made high at the same time an SR
latch is said to be level sensitive this

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.159
means it will respond to a valid change
in either S or R regardless of the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.009
duration of the input pulse it's the
level high or low that matters not how

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.650
long it's applied for to build a gated
SR latch we can make some simple

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.110
enhancements to an SR latch by
connecting a pair of and gates in series

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.570
with the inputs of an or based SR latch
we've created a third input E which can

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.090
be used to enable or disable the
latching effect a regular and gate will

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.700
only have a high output if both inputs
are high so only when E is set to one

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.950
with a one from s or a one from r get
through to our cross connected nor gates

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.440
here's an SR latch built from NAND gates
this is a level sensitive

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.800
active low sr latch in other words both
s and r are normally high and it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.470
requires a low pulse that's a zero to be
applied to s in order to set it it also

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.640
requires a low pulse to be applied to R
in order to reset it by connecting an

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.990
extra pair of NAND gates to the latch
like this not only have we created a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.900
third input E we now have a new circuit
in which the normal states of s and r

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.470
are zero and high pulses are required to
set or reset the latch in other words

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.380
our NAND based latch has been changed
from an active low latch into an active

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.560
high latch these additional gates on a
basic SR latch are sometimes referred to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.640
as steering gates an SR latch without
steering gates is said to be transparent

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.239
a valid input will affect the output
unconditionally a gated SR latch on the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.170
other hand is transparent only when it's
enabled it's convenient to give a gated

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.239
SR latch its own symbol because we can
now focus on what the latch does rather

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.120
than what's going on inside it the
inputs S E and R are still shown and so

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.550
is the output q and its inverse not Q

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.069
we can illustrate what's going on at any
one of the inputs or the output on a

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:58.159
chart showing changes in voltage against
time at any given moment the voltage

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.140
will be either low zero volts to all
intents and purposes and representing

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.780
the binary value zero or high at about
five volts representing the binary value

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.379
one now of course everything can happen
very quickly in a digital circuit each

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.699
time interval on this chart could be in
the order of a microsecond that's a

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.990
millionth of a second
having said that for a level sensitive

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.880
gated SR latch each time interval might
be one second or one minute or even an

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.010
hour it really depends on the
application for the purposes of this

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.780
discussion it takes no time for the
voltage to change from low to high or

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.139
from high to low in reality this
transition takes a few nanoseconds the

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.910
significance of which we'll ignore for
now but come back to in a later video

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.120
let's proceed on the assumption that
switching from low to high or vice-versa

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.490
is instantaneous this gives us the
classic square wave that you can see

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:07.520
here we now have a convenient way to
describe the behavior of a latch by

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.130
stacking several charts together one for
each input S R D and one for the output Q

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.820
with a common time axis we can visualize
this circuit in action at the time

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.910
indicated by the vertical yellow line
the output Q is low s and R are also

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.660
both low but E is high so the latch is
enabled in fact in this diagram the

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.820
latch is always enabled so it's going to
behave exactly like a simple SR latch

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.620
without steering gates as time passes if
s goes high

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:54.970
so does Q because it's a latch when s
drops to low again Q stays high

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:07.039
if s goes high while Q is high it has no
effect Q is already high when R goes

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:23.389
high Q goes low when s goes high again
so does Q this is normal latching

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.989
behavior

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:50.870
again we see R going high so the
latches reset again the latch is already

00:06:50.870 --> 00:07:02.719
reset so another pulse at R has no
effect now let's examine what happens

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:09.620
when E varies you can see that some of
the time he is high and some of the time

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:17.690
E is low we begin with an output of
zero at Q and because E is low the

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:32.060
latch is disabled s goes high but it has
no effect on the output of the latch now

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.500
E is high the latch is enabled so when
s goes high

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:44.270
so does Q and when s drops too low again
the latch stays high until such time as

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:55.610
R goes high and then Q drops to zero
again now E is zero the latch is no

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:03.729
longer enabled so if s goes high it has
no effect on Q

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:20.690
E is high again the latch is enabled
and so it responds when s goes high the

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:31.790
latch is set again E goes to zero the
latch is disabled R goes high but Q

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:44.060
doesn't drop it remains in its high
state to summarize that an SR latch

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:49.700
built from nor gates can be turned into
a gated SR latch by adding a pair of and

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:57.170
gates to it an SR latch built from NAND
gates can be turned into a gated SR

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:02.420
latch by adding another pair of NAND
gates to it this also has the effect of

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:10.100
changing the SR latch from an active low
to an active high latch a gated SR latch

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:16.220
has an additional input e which must be
high before the latch will respond to

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:23.420
any changes in S or R the gated SR latch
has its own symbol to simplify diagrams

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:31.240
and the behavior of a latch can be
described by means of a timing diagram
