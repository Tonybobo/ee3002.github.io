00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.560
in this session we are going to discuss
JK flip-flop JK this term has come

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.710
against the name Jack Kilby
who is a famous engineer at Texas

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:23.100
Instruments who has invented integrated
circuit in the year 1958 so in case of

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.710
JK flip-flop we are going to solve the
race condition of SR  flip flop

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.530
we know that race condition of a SR
flip flop was solved in D flip flop by connecting

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.230
our inputs through one not gate
but D flip-flop

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
was having only one input line so two
input combinations are possible that is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.020
0 and 1 so now I want to have if 2 input
flip-flop where the race condition will

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.199
be resolved and that is the version we
are observing in JK flip-flop so here is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.940
the respective circuit for us we know
that in case of SR flip flop if we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.880
provide 1 1 as input and when the inner
flip-flop from the clock is getting 1 1

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.600
as input then the race condition was
getting restored so now to resolve that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.930
issue
what do you are doing if we provide 1 1

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.820
to J and K inputs in in that case also Q
Bar and Q is getting ended with them so

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.740
Q or Q bar either one of them will be 0
and another one of them will be 1 so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.860
ultimately the inner flip flop is not
getting 1 1 as input either it will be

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.920
getting 0 1 as input or 1 0 as input so
the race condition problem has been

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.890
resolved in our JK flip-flop and also
this JK flip-flop is having two inputs J

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.700
and K and that's why we can have 4 input
combinations so here is a truth table

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.799
for this JK flip-flop so JK and previous
support which will decide the next

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.869
output so out of them let us take any
one of them arbitrarily and he shall

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.930
show really this truth table is working
fine so let us take this this one

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.360
so that means for one one input whether
in where in case of SR flip flop it was

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.069
supposed to produce indeterminate
condition here it will be producing one

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.000
as output if the output was 0 initially so
let us stress this one on this circuit

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.180
so one one for JK and we are having 0
for Q(t) so here will be 1 and let me

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.860
check what is the next output coming so
now in this case if I make this clock

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.489
pulse 1 so 1 will be coming here 1 is
coming here and 0 is coming here so it

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.440
is producing 0 because and gate if one of
the inputs is 0 then output will be 0 in

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.660
that case and here we are having 3 1 so
input will be 1 in case of nor gate if

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.209
one of the inputs is 1 then output will
be 0 so here will be here it will be 0

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.360
so 0 will be coming here 0 or 0 is 0 not
up that 1 so the next value of Q will be

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.549
1 and that has been shown in the truth
table so in this way this particular

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.329
circuit has been tested for this input
combination at your end you can also

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.170
test with other at any input
combinations you can work you can see

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.280
that it is working fine on the circuit
so this is the truth table of this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.599
circuit so now let us have the
characteristic equation so I am plotting

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.000
this Q(t+1) on this 3 variable
karnaugh map here we are having j and k

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.959
Q(t)  so we're having this J K and Q(t)  so
now all of them are in the same sequence

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:55.680
so I am going for 4 here so 0 1 0 0
so 0 1 0 0 here we are having this 1 1 1

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.480
0 so 1 1 1 0 so I am finding this so
here I will be getting 1 cover and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.370
another cover will be this one so
ultimately it is nothing but

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:23.699
so Q bar Q(t)  and this one is J and
the last one is this one so in this way

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.750
we have got the characteristic equation
of JK flip flop from this truth table

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.349
now let us go for the other two table
constructions

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.210
so our next table is the characteristic
table where we shall find out what will

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.120
be the output when certain input is
known to us so for the 0 0 input

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.520
now finding here we are having 0 0 so
the previous support we are getting so I

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:58.080
am writing this one as Q(t ) for 0 1 and
finding this one as 0 for 1 0 I am finding

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.539
this one as 1 and for 1 1 I am finding
this one as when it was 0 it will be 1

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.330
when it was 1 it will be 0 so it will be
Q Bar T that means the previous output

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.060
will get complimented if I provide 1 1 to
J and K inputs so in this way the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.530
character suitable we have done now we
are remaining with the excitation table

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.520
in case of excitation table we are
having the supports and for this output

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.190
change or transition at the input
combination so 0 0 0 to 0

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:39.000
so finding here 1 0 to 0 finding here 1
0 to 0 so here you are having 0 0 and 0

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:48.419
1 so if we go on combining them so it is
0 and X so here J must be 0 and K can be

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:54.690
0 or 1 anything so next one will be 0 to
1 transition so finding this one here

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.440
and finding this one here so here it is
1 0 and here it is 1 1 so 1 is fixed and

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.840
0 1 means we can make it X you can make
it X so 1 is fixed and here it is 0 here

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.060
it is 1 so I'm making this one X next
is 1 to 0 transition 1 to 0 transition

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.180
we are finding here I am finding here so
here it means this one and this one so that

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.650
is 0 1 and 1 1 0 means
zero is zero and one means X and 1 and 1

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.860
means 1 I can write this one here so I'm
looking for the last one that is 1 1 so

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.820
here you are finding this one
combination and finding this combination

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.360
here also so it is 0 0 and it is 1 0 so
0 is fixed and 0 1 1 anything can be

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.730
applied so I'm making this one as X 0 so
that is the required excitation table

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.310
for the JK flip-flop this is the block
diagram of JK flip-flops so here we are

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.730
having J and K and clock pulse as input
and Q and Q Bar will be the output

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.790
JK flip flop is having one problem here
you see for one one input output will

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.130
get complimented so when the output will
get complemented then through the

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.900
feedback paths those are put will be
again coming to the inputs and if at

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.220
that time if the clock pulse is still on
then again the output will get

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.360
complemented and again through the
feedback paths the new outputs will be

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.160
coming to the inputs and if the clock
pulses still on then then again the

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.690
output will get complimented so as a
result of that multiple times the output

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.890
may get complemented if the clock pulse
is remaining high for a certain period

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.140
of time which is much much greater than
the delay time of the this feedback

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:53.010
paths so that's why if even number of
times of rolling takes place then output

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:58.410
will not be complemented ultimately at
the end if the rolling is taking place

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.970
for odd number of times the output
will get complemented ultimately

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.550
so the output will become is
unpredictable so that's why this

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.530
condition is known as turn around
condition this particular condition is

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:19.740
known as turn around condition and that
is the basic problem with clocked JK

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.660
flip-flop so in the next video we'll be
discussing that is how to resolve this

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:31.520
one using master slave JK flip-flop
