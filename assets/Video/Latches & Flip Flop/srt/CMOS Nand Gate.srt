1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,220
In this class We are going to discuss about
CMOS nand gate in the last class. We discussed

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:17,490
the about designing of same nand gate by using
P mos and n mos in this class we going to discuss designing nand gate by using CMOS logic.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,900
So as you know, that CMOS is the combination
of P mos and n mos as P mos is taken as pull-up

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,869
transistor and then n mos is taken under pulled down. So here same For Designing CMOS nand

5
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:38,250
gate also P mos nand is considered upside.
So n mos and is considered as pulled off So

6
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,290
here you can absorb.This is p mo's nand gate
and this is again n mos nand gate both are cascaded

7
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:51,770
in vertical like this.Then it will form CMOS
nand gate now. We will see it will works as

8
00:00:51,770 --> 00:01:03,829
a CMOS nand or not. So here for the time considering
say A B values here.A B and you are transistors.

9
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:15,760
So that means Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 and your output
voltage Vo. So see when your output

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:26,610
Vo is equal and to 1 means whenever it is
connected to Vdd by anyway, then only your output

11
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,700
connected to ground whenever it's connecting
to ground even though it is connected to Vdd

12
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:39,159
see here don't confuse for P mos N mos and
all this so here whenever you take an output

13
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,980
in middle, so whenever it is connected to
ground, so even though it is connected for Vdd

14
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:54,210
we will assume 0 so now see here
so the combinations are 0 0 0 1 1 0 and 1

15
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:05,630
1 that means you know that for P mos So this
is p mos is only on for zero and off for

16
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:19,951
one like that N mos will on for one and off
for zero. So, you know that Q3 and Q4 are

17
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:28,930
n mos and q1 and Q2 are P mos these two are
P Mo's transistors and these two are n mos

18
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:36,599
transistors. So this is n mos so now I'm just
writing switch off on  values of

19
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,870
this transistors for n mos and p mos so whenever
a equal to 0 b equal to 0 whenever a equal

20
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:53,749
to 0 B equal to 0 both p mo's are going
to on that means so Q1 on Q2 on same low voltage

21
00:02:53,749 --> 00:03:04,260
if we're given two n mos then those are going
to off So any mosfet is off means it will

22
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,540
be open circuited here. These two transistors
are off mean is here you are getting open

23
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,230
circuit path? And here these two p mo's are on means here. You are having short path like

24
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,419
this or like this then in this case you are
output is going to cut with this ground. And

25
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:31,250
this is going to connect with your Source
voltage in this case You are getting one Output.

26
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:38,669
So now in this case second case zero one condition.
So in zero one condition your Q1 is going

27
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:46,809
to on and you are Q2 is going to off as that
is p mos for p mos . If you given high voltage

28
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:53,629
and that's going to off reverse case in n
mos if you given high voltage then Q4 is going

29
00:03:53,629 --> 00:04:03,029
to on and here here A is 0 then this n mos
is going to Off so here n mos is going to

30
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:11,579
off for 0 and N mos is going to on for one.Now.
You can see the connection q1 is on you are

31
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:20,229
having short path like this Q 1 is on and you
are you Q2 is off that means here you are

32
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:27,689
having open circuit and here you can absorb
your Q3 is off that means here. You are having

33
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,490
open path by It's open path you are output
is going to cut with this ground. Even though

34
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:41,770
you are Q4 is short circuited as Q3 is
open circuited your path is going to cut with

35
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,740
output. Then this output is going to connect
with Vdd through Q1 see Q1 is on means you

36
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:55,111
are having short circuit So now this output
is going to connect through Q1 to Vdd. So

37
00:04:55,111 --> 00:05:02,490
anyway, it's connected to Vdd means you are
getting high output. So in next case 1 0 case

38
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:08,990
in this case you are first two p mos is going
to off and the second p mos is going to on

39
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:17,080
because we provided zero reverse of that if
you provided one here Q3 is on and as you

40
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:26,020
provided 0 here Q4 is off that means n
mos will off for low voltage So you will see

41
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,930
so here your second transistor is on. That
means here you are having short path and here

42
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,780
coming to here. So this is on and this is
off. That means Q3 is on but Q4 is off from

43
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,830
output to here. You are having short path.
When coming to here you are having open path

44
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:52,960
by this opens circuit Our your connection is going
to lose from Vo to ground. Then this Vo is

45
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,080
going to connect with this VDD through this
Q2 p mos.

46
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,909
So then when it Is connected to Vdd here itself
here. Also, you are going to get one at output

47
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:13,099
are high voltage at the output in case of
1 1 that means both p mo's and n mos are given

48
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:21,039
with one in both input case that means so
A is equal to 1 B is equal to 1 so far this

49
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,439
both p mos are going to off both n mos are
going to on both p mos are going to off

50
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:34,099
means you are going to lose your Connection
from output to Source voltage and both n mos

51
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:39,930
is going to on means you are going to get
shotrs circuit path from output to ground.These

52
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,639
two n mos are going to on means here. You
are having short path from output to ground

53
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:52,900
and you are losing this connection because
of open path in Q1 and Q2. Both p mo's are

54
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,300
off means both having open circuit. There
is no way to connect with VDD So in this case,

55
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,879
As output is connecting with to ground you
are going to get 0 volts at output If You

56
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:13,240
observe this truth table when you are providing
at least one low input, then you are getting

57
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,400
high output whenever all the inputs are high
then only you are going to get low voltage

58
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,409
at output. That means this is the nand functionality.
This is Nand functionality. That means 1 into

59
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:34,009
0 whole bar 1 0 into one whole bar Do I need
to 0 whole bar 1 1 into one whole bar 0 so

60
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:39,729
we can set that by observing. This truth table
came from the circuit so we can say that this

61
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:46,870
will works as nand gate So this is the designing
of CMOS nand gate. So CMOS is nothing

62
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,539
but integrating P Mos with n mos p mos structure
as pull up and n mos structure as pull down.

63
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:58,639
So like this way we can design any circuit
in CMOS functionality by using CMOS logic
