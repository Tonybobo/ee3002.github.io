00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:09,450
a gated set/reset latch is an SR latch
that can only change state while it's

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,089
enabled for example imagine an air
conditioning system in a building each

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,320
room could have its own cooling unit
controlled independently by its own SR

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,119
latch the set and reset signals might
come from a temperature sensor or a

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,080
humidity sensor in the room if these
were gated SR latches then a central

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,219
control panel could be used to enable or
disable the switching on and off of

7
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,710
these units on a room-by-room basis

8
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:47,309
here's an Un-gated SR latch remember an
SR latch built from nor gates like this

9
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,879
one is an active high SR latch this
means it requires a high pulse that's a

10
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,640
1 to be applied at input s in order to
get a high output at Q in other words to

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,090
set the latch alternatively to reset the
latch and make the output at Q zero it

12
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,409
requires a high pulse to be applied to
input arm it's invalid for both s and R

13
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:21,270
to be made high at the same time an SR
latch is said to be level sensitive this

14
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,159
means it will respond to a valid change
in either S or R regardless of the

15
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,009
duration of the input pulse it's the
level high or low that matters not how

16
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,650
long it's applied for to build a gated
SR latch we can make some simple

17
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,110
enhancements to an SR latch by
connecting a pair of and gates in series

18
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,570
with the inputs of an or based SR latch
we've created a third input E which can

19
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,090
be used to enable or disable the
latching effect a regular and gate will

20
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,700
only have a high output if both inputs
are high so only when E is set to one

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,950
with a one from s or a one from r get
through to our cross connected nor gates

22
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:13,440
here's an SR latch built from NAND gates
this is a level sensitive

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,800
active low sr latch in other words both
s and r are normally high and it

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,470
requires a low pulse that's a zero to be
applied to s in order to set it it also

25
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,640
requires a low pulse to be applied to R
in order to reset it by connecting an

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,990
extra pair of NAND gates to the latch
like this not only have we created a

27
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,900
third input E we now have a new circuit
in which the normal states of s and r

28
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,470
are zero and high pulses are required to
set or reset the latch in other words

29
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,380
our NAND based latch has been changed
from an active low latch into an active

30
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:04,560
high latch these additional gates on a
basic SR latch are sometimes referred to

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,640
as steering gates an SR latch without
steering gates is said to be transparent

32
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,239
a valid input will affect the output
unconditionally a gated SR latch on the

33
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,170
other hand is transparent only when it's
enabled it's convenient to give a gated

34
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,239
SR latch its own symbol because we can
now focus on what the latch does rather

35
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,120
than what's going on inside it the
inputs S E and R are still shown and so

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,550
is the output q and its inverse not Q

37
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,069
we can illustrate what's going on at any
one of the inputs or the output on a

38
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:58,159
chart showing changes in voltage against
time at any given moment the voltage

39
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,140
will be either low zero volts to all
intents and purposes and representing

40
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,780
the binary value zero or high at about
five volts representing the binary value

41
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,379
one now of course everything can happen
very quickly in a digital circuit each

42
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:19,699
time interval on this chart could be in
the order of a microsecond that's a

43
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,990
millionth of a second
having said that for a level sensitive

44
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,880
gated SR latch each time interval might
be one second or one minute or even an

45
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,010
hour it really depends on the
application for the purposes of this

46
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,780
discussion it takes no time for the
voltage to change from low to high or

47
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,139
from high to low in reality this
transition takes a few nanoseconds the

48
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,910
significance of which we'll ignore for
now but come back to in a later video

49
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,120
let's proceed on the assumption that
switching from low to high or vice-versa

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,490
is instantaneous this gives us the
classic square wave that you can see

51
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:07,520
here we now have a convenient way to
describe the behavior of a latch by

52
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,130
stacking several charts together one for
each input S R D and one for the output Q

53
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:19,820
with a common time axis we can visualize
this circuit in action at the time

54
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,910
indicated by the vertical yellow line
the output Q is low s and R are also

55
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:32,660
both low but E is high so the latch is
enabled in fact in this diagram the

56
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,820
latch is always enabled so it's going to
behave exactly like a simple SR latch

57
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:45,620
without steering gates as time passes if
s goes high

58
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:54,970
so does Q because it's a latch when s
drops to low again Q stays high

59
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:07,039
if s goes high while Q is high it has no
effect Q is already high when R goes

60
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:23,389
high Q goes low when s goes high again
so does Q this is normal latching

61
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,989
behavior

62
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:50,870
again we see R going high so the
latches reset again the latch is already

63
00:06:50,870 --> 00:07:02,719
reset so another pulse at R has no
effect now let's examine what happens

64
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:09,620
when E varies you can see that some of
the time he is high and some of the time

65
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,690
E is low we begin with an output of
zero at Q and because E is low the

66
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:32,060
latch is disabled s goes high but it has
no effect on the output of the latch now

67
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,500
E is high the latch is enabled so when
s goes high

68
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:44,270
so does Q and when s drops too low again
the latch stays high until such time as

69
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:55,610
R goes high and then Q drops to zero
again now E is zero the latch is no

70
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:03,729
longer enabled so if s goes high it has
no effect on Q

71
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:20,690
E is high again the latch is enabled
and so it responds when s goes high the

72
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:31,790
latch is set again E goes to zero the
latch is disabled R goes high but Q

73
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:44,060
doesn't drop it remains in its high
state to summarize that an SR latch

74
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,700
built from nor gates can be turned into
a gated SR latch by adding a pair of and

75
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:57,170
gates to it an SR latch built from NAND
gates can be turned into a gated SR

76
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,420
latch by adding another pair of NAND
gates to it this also has the effect of

77
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:10,100
changing the SR latch from an active low
to an active high latch a gated SR latch

78
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,220
has an additional input e which must be
high before the latch will respond to

79
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:23,420
any changes in S or R the gated SR latch
has its own symbol to simplify diagrams

80
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:31,240
and the behavior of a latch can be
described by means of a timing diagram
