1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,220
In this class. We are going to discuss about
CMOS Nor gate in the last class. We designed

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,310
nand gate by using CMOS
So as you know that CMOS having two mos transistors

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:20,060
that is P mos and N mos It's just having P
mos as pull up and N mos as you pull down and

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:28,010
here when we are designing any gate or any
functionality. Then you need to give P mos

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,370
functionality of that particular functionality.
As pull up and the N Mo's logic of that particular

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:41,469
functionality as pull down here. We are going
to design CMOS nor gate if you want CMOS nor

7
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:49,350
gate you need to Cascade P mos nor gate as
pull-up and n mos nor gate as pull down here.You

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,570
can absorb up to here. This is p mos nor gate
and this is n mos nor gate by connecting this

9
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,390
P mos and N mos nor gate you are going to
get Get your CMOS nor gate this P mos nor gate

10
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,040
and CMOS nor gate we already discussed
in the last two classes. Now, we will see

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:16,380
this circuit will work for nor operation or
not that will see now. So here we are having

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,380
two inputs A and B same inputs. We are giving
for both p mos and n mos so here. I am considering

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,749
that inputs a b and I am just considering
my P Mo's transistor cells q1 and Q2 and then

14
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:44,939
n  mos transistors as Q3 and Q4. So here Q1
Q2 Q3 Q4 and your output Vo so now for

15
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:53,850
two input variables you are combinations maybe
four that four combinations are 0 0 0 1 1 0

16
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:04,039
1 1 now as you know that P mos will on
this is p, Mos So P mos will on for 0 and

17
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:17,420
off for 1This is n mos.So n mos will on for
1 and off for 0. So now when you are output

18
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,610
is going to get 0 when you are output is going
to get one means whenever you are output is

19
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,620
connected to Vdd. Then you are coming in getting
high voltage at output when you were output

20
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,959
is connected to ground by this way or this
way, then you are going to get zero at output.

21
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,291
So when you are going to connect to ground
means whenever anyone of this n Mo's transistor

22
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:47,459
is on then it will forms shorts circuit. by
that short circuit path you are going to connect

23
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,460
with the ground then coming to hear when your output is going to connect with Vdd means

24
00:02:53,460 --> 00:03:02,299
Whenever two transistors whenever both transistors
P Mo's transistors are on then only you are

25
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:09,560
output is going to connect with vdd or otherwise
if anyone of the one transistor P Mo's transistor

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,069
is off then the short circuit path will cut
then you are Output is not going to connect

27
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:21,439
with your supply voltage. So in that case
it's going to connect with ground. So now

28
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,939
see the operation here. So whenever both transistors
are on then only it's going to connect with

29
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:32,439
VDD.
So if anyone of this transistor is on then

30
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:40,930
it's going to connect with ground. So now
see here when we given 0 0 So these two are

31
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,769
P Mo's transistors and these two are n Mo's
transistors. So when we give input as 0 P

32
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:57,489
Mo's transistors are going to on and n mos
is going to off.So see here. So n mos is going

33
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:04,010
to off here You'll get open circuit.
So here you will get open circuit. So like

34
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:11,739
this you will get opens circuit and here both
transistors Both p mos are on means here like

35
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:18,030
this You are having short circuit. So now
you can imagine so this Vo is not having

36
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:25,520
path like this this this same Vo is not
having any path like this because here It's

37
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,009
having actually two paths like this or like
this the two parts are in opens  circuited

38
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:39,160
So that means we are not having any connection
in between Vo and ground and now you can see

39
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,320
you are having this short circuit path from
Vo to VDD in this case you are output is equal

40
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:53,599
to one or high voltage vdd now in case
of 0 1 if you give A equal to 0 B equal to

41
00:04:53,599 --> 00:05:01,830
1 then p mos will on for zero n mos will off for
zero that means for same for P Mo's transistor

42
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:11,490
will on but this n Mo's transistor will off
so here. So for one, your p mos will

43
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:18,340
off and n mos will on n mos will on so you
can see here.

44
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:25,840
So this whatever q1 is there that is on that
means up to here you. Having short circuit

45
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,060
but coming to Q2. This is open circuited because
Q2 is off. That means open circuited then

46
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:43,460
coming to this connection. So Q3 is off Q3
is open circuited, but Q4 is on Q4 is on means

47
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:50,830
like this. So now you can observe really clear
any path that here to here here you have open

48
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:57,520
path. That means the Vo to VDD connection
is lost here due to this open circuit and

49
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,110
you are having a short path between Vo to ground
by this Q4. So now in this case you are output

50
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,289
is going to connect with ground through this
short circuit path forward by Q4 N mos transistor.

51
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:17,460
Then in this case you are output is equal
to 0 now. come to 1 0 combination. If you give

52
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,729
an A is equal to 1 B is equal to 0 if you
given a equal one P mos is going to

53
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:35,490
off. And your n mos is going to on. So if
you give any A as 1 p mos is going to off

54
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:42,560
n mos is going to on the same way If you give
B is equal to 0 you are P mos is going

55
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:50,080
to on your P mos is going to on and your n
mos is going to off now. I can see the connection.

56
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,710
So if Q1 is off you are having open circuit
here and when Q2 is on you are having short

57
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:05,789
circuit like this and when Q3 Is on you are
having short circuit like this and Q4 is off

58
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:13,680
Mean. Now This is open circuited. Now, you
can see where you are having path Vo to VDD

59
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,770
path is lost because of this opens circuit so
up to here you are having bar, but here this

60
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,569
is open circuited and coming to here here.
This is open circuited. But here you are having

61
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:33,780
path to ground. So you are having in this
case you are having  Vo to ground connection

62
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,780
through this Q3 short circuit path. In this
case. Also, your output is going to connect

63
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:45,099
with ground means you are getting zero.So
now in case of 1 1, if you are providing

64
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:52,939
a equal to 1 b equal to 1 you are both p mo's
are transistors are going to off that means

65
00:07:52,939 --> 00:08:03,030
so like this and both n mos on like this so
here both are of means both Having opens circuit

66
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:09,360
and here both are having short circuit in
this case. Also your now you lost path between

67
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,909
Vo to V DD because of this open circuit and
here by this way or this way your output

68
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:22,280
is going to connect with ground. So that means
you're going to get zero and it is connected

69
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,439
with ground. It's going to get 0 now. You
can observe this truth table. If You observe

70
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:34,900
this truth table whenever all All signals
are all inputs are 0 then only or getting

71
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,850
one if any one of the input is 1 then you
are getting 0 at output. So this is the meaning

72
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:48,940
of nor operation. So by this functionality
functional truth table obtained by the circuit

73
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:57,530
so we can say this circuit will act as nor
gate so as this is CMOS logic, so this this

74
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,960
is called as CMOS nor gate.
