00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:07.520
Hello friends today, our topic is SRam 6T,
so we will see first the meaning of the circuit

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.150
then we will see the read and write operation
then further we will see some specification

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.289
design what we have to keep in the mind when
we have to design this SRAM 6T.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.590
Let's go step by step.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.130
Now the first point is circuit.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.109
So let's understand this circuit first, we
will go from inside out then we will understand

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.130
from outside in first you have to understand
this.This is the memory part.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.960
This whole part is the memory part.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.420
So what we have done is we have connected
two inverters.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:45.129
This is basically the structure we are connecting two inverters in this fashion. Now this is from the basic NOR Gate

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.720
we have change this to the CMOS inverters because the working
is same as CMOS inverter and nor gate

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.129
same we have connected this using CMOS inverter.

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.200
Now, this will act as memory.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.390
How let's say we have one here.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.739
Now, the inversion of 1 is 0 again 0 will
go and it would be inverted again.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.560
So one now, you can note that this will act
as memory because this side will always be

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.869
1 and this side will always be 0 now the output
are taken as q and Q bar.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.210
Now you can note that this q and Q Bar are
this outputs simple Now Memory part is clear.You

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820
You can note that memory part is clear.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.990
Now, we have to talk about this access transistor.Now,
you can note that this memory has to be connected

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.829
to something that we can read and we can write
if it is connected to some line then we can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.109
read what is in the memory and we can write
into that see bit and bit bar will act as

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:50.420
that line now to access this lines.We use
the access transistor the word access used.All

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.479
right.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.259
now you can see that the second
point is now if word line is 1 what will

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.809
happen if this is 1 means both this access
transistor are on this means that we can access

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:09.549
this bit and bit bar line if suppose it is
0 so in one read and write operation are possible

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:11.790
because this can be active.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.989
But if it is 0 what will happen if this is
0 the access are lost.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.709
So the memory will be in the whole state.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.799
So the second Was word line significance if
it is one read and write is possible.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.710
If it is 0 we are in the whole state.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.710
Now.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.870
The third question is if we are in the read
and write set how you will read and write

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.690
so the significance of bit and bit bar line
is here.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.310
This will act as input line when we have to
write into the memory.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.840
So this will act as input line when we have
to write into the memory if we have to read

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.989
from the memory.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.599
This will act as the output lines.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:58.410
So bit and bit bar is equal to input when
we have to write and we have to it will act

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.930
as output when we have to read from the memory.So
third point was between bit and bit bar these

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.519
are the pre charged capacitor will be used
pre charged capacitor will be used in read

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.140
and write operation.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.329
So its significance in read and write operation.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.989
Now, let's go from outside.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.769
So pre charged capacitor used in read and
write bit and bit bar for input and output

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.519
access transistor to make sure that we can
use the input and output.Now, this is the

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.409
memory this are the output of the inverter
as you can see simplified version.

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.299
Now let's talk about the working of read and
write.The second point is read operation read

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.030
operation is very important.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.620
See you have to note this point first when
we talk about real this means memory should

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.310
hold some value.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.999
Let's say Q is 1 and Q Bar is the complement.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.470
So if Q is 1 Q Bar will be 0 now.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.930
You can note that Q is 1 Q Bar is 0 first
point second point we have to read as we have

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.689
to read we have to use this lines.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.920
Now question is if we have to use this line
what we have to do we have to make this word

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.140
line as one so if word line is one this access
transistor will be on if these are on we can

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.140
use this right.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.140
Now.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.280
The third point is we are using this line.So
what we have to make sure that it is input

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.990
or output see memory has some value and we have
to read some value.So what will be this right?

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.370
This would be the output lines.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.560
So we have to make sure bit and bit bar.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.120
Are the output lines

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.700
Right?  third point is that now let's talk about
the 4 point means as I said this capacitor

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.220
has significance in read and write operation.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.000
So this would be pre-charged.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.710
So pre-charged means at this node.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.580
The value of the voltage would be VDD similarly
at this node.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:59.340
The value of voltage would be VDD So the pre
charge capacitors is the fourth point.Now

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.180
the fifth point is is there a voltage difference
you can see at here and add Q is equal to

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.449
1 there is no voltage difference.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.840
So capacitor will not discharge.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.949
Let's take here Q Bar is 0 the node voltages
here VDD Is there a voltage difference 0 & 1

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.840
yes, there is a voltage difference.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.120
So capacitor will discharge now current will
flow and capacitor will discharge so this

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.110
node voltage will decrease so with bar.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.440
Voltage will decrease so now six point is
fifth point is very important because this

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.169
will lead to the answer.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.530
So here let's take a recap voltage here
VDD voltage here 0 voltage difference.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.690
Yes current will flow.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.040
Yes capacitor discharge and when capacitor
discharge voltage decreases at this node.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.169
This means that bit power voltage decreases.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:58.910
Now what we have to do we have to send this
values of bit and bit bar to this sense amplifier.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:05.880
Now this sense amplifier will act as comparator.And
when comparator will say if bit BAR value

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.350
decreases,then the output should be if bit
BAR value decreases.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.990
Then the output should be 1 right.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.360
So if this will happen then we have successfully
you can see read from the memory because the

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.889
memory has the value 1 and we have successfully
read output is equal to one.

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.520
Now this is the read operation.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.949
Now, let's take another example suppose Q
is 0 Q Bar is one now.

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.520
You have to think and say the answer what
will happen take some time.So if you have

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.160
pause this video and sort it then you will
note that second point will remain as it is

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.080
Word line is 1 this is also same bit and
bit bar will act as output because we have

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.740
to read from the memory fourth point is pre-charged
that will always happen right pre charged

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.740
capacitor.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.210
Now fifth point is now we have to note that
Q Bar is 1 and this is VDD no voltage difference.No

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.840
current will flow when we talk about here.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.560
You can see voltage is VDD, but Q is now 0
so What will happen voltage difference means

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.840
current will flow this means that capacitor
will discharge when capacitor discharge bit

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.930
voltage decreases.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.770
So bit line voltage decreases.So bit voltage
decreases is the fifth point.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.129
So that's why I have marked it important because
from here we will get the answer.

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:32.939
So six point Was Bit and bit Bar sent to
sense amplifier correct comparator.

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:42.610
It will check now it will check if bit voltage
decreases then the output is equal to 0.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.389
So all depends on the comparator, right?

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:51.740
So if bit line voltage decreases the output
value is 0 so we have successfully read that

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.219
if memory has the value zero we have successfully
read that the output that is the value of

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:11.539
memory is equal to zero.
