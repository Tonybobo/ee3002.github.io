00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.690
these sessions topic is memory chip
organization how the memory it may be

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.179
RAM may be ROM how this memory have
got fabricated how these chip

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.789
organizations are being made so actually
we are having two categories for that

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.010
one is a 2d organization and the another is the 2 and half D organization

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.330
so let me discuss them one by one I'm
having the suitable diagram with me so I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.430
shall discuss with my diagrams so now
this is my 2d organization and this one

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.000
is my 2 and half D  the organization and
what are the advantages disadvantages

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.100
where I should go for 2d and 2 and half D organization
I should discuss everything here in this

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.700
session so now you see this is a decoder
let us suppose it is having 3 bits as

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.380
input you know that decoder is the
combinational circuit which will have n

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.000
number of input lines including the
power of n number of output lines and

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.640
depending upon the combination of the
input one of the output lines will be

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.590
selected at a time that that is the
basic and fundamental logic of a decoder

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.090
circuit so here we are having 3 input
lines and we are having eight output

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.040
lines at here so depending upon the
input bit combination one of the output

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.689
lines will be enabled and with the
particular output line we're having say

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.700
eight vertical lines we were having say in
eight vertical lines are there so now what

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.490
will happen so it might be eight might
be sixteen might be 24 so that is not

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.909
dependent on this decoder side so the
word that means word means the number of

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.470
bits in this particular line will be
coming out through this i/o circuit

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.630
whether the bits will be coming out or
going in obviously that will be decided

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.960
by this control line read or write so if
the control line is enable for read then

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.700
the data will be coming out through the
data to the data lines and if it is

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.890
writes then it'll be going in to the
respective word to be written to get

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.780
overwritten so that is the issue so
we're here we are having to develop of n

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.950
number of words if we have n
of select lines in this decoders input

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.740
so 2 ^ n number of words and you can
have M number of N and M they are not

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.590
related so M number of output lines
through this column IO circuit we know

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.900
that for the memory read and memory
write we are having two registers one is

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900
called memory address registered in
short MAR and the other one is your memory

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.370
data registered in short it is MDR while
performing read operation MAR will be

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.530
containing the address from the MAR the
address will be coming to the decoder

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.209
input the respective world will get
selected depending upon the combination

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.950
and the output does obtained if I select
it in the read mode will be coming to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.940
the MDR  memory data register in case
of memory write the MAR will be

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.890
containing the target memory locations
address so from the address from the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.360
address register that means from the
MAR  memory address register the address

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.190
will be coming to the decoders input
respective word will get selected and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.100
here I shall put the right control mode
enabled and then these data lines

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.390
through these data lines the respective
bits will be going to the respective

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.090
word to get written so in this way the
memory read and memory write will take

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.440
place for 2d organization
so let us come to the 2 and half D next

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.760
so in cases of 2 and half D organization
we are having the same kind of scenario

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.859
but here we are having some column bits
so in the column also we are having one

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.380
decoder so in the column also we are
having one decoder not the column IO

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.340
circuit so depending upon the bits in
the input and depending upon the bits in

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.079
this particular decoders input so one of
the output lines will get selected and

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.769
one of the output lines will get
selected let us suppose it will select

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.479
this particular cell to select this
particular cell so this line has got

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.250
enabled and say this line has got
enabled so this particular location has

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.630
got selected so from that very location
I should

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.300
that it is a bit position  at
the junction of these two one is the one

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.110
is the row line row line another one is
the column line so at the intersection

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.730
we are having one bit
so at that very bit position this

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.020
read/write control line will decide
whether I am writing then through

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.400
between the bit will come and that will
be written here if this control line

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.360
selects I'll be going for the reading
operation then from this bit the data

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.100
will be coming out that data bit will be
coming out to this bit output line so

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.280
what will happen each and every location
will contain a single bit so now how

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.160
many words do require how many bits of
word per location 64 so 64 such

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.170
parallel circuits will be working 32 32
such parallel circuits will be working

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.390
so now let us go for the comparisons
here the number of column output lines

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.910
are fixed hardware fixed but here how
many bits were going to get against a

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.200
single word that we shall we shall
decide because that number of circuits

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.570
will be working in parallel and here you
see the full address bits will be

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.850
divided into two part so this is some
bits will be coming down here some bits

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.500
will be coming down here so say we are
having 6 bits address so 3 bits here and

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.400
3 bits here
so six bits means how many combinations

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.060
6 bits means 64 combinations so 3 bits
means how many rows 8 rows 3 bits means

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.440
how many columns 8 columns so 8 rows and
8 columns so how many Junction points 64

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.880
so in this way you are getting the 64
but here all the 6 bits will be

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.260
applicable here so 64 horizontal lines
will be coming out so it will it will be

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.760
equating more complicated hardware
compared to this one so that is one

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.380
advantage second advantage here you see
I told you that it will be

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.020
requiring less Hardware less circuitry
less geeks next advantage point is

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.640
that here in this particular circuit as
we are having lesser number of hard

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.480
words and
logic gates and so on so the pin the IC

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.190
pin will be lesser number so easy to
implement easy to implement easy to

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.990
fabricate and next one is that here we
are getting from each and every circuit

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.140
we are getting a single bit depending
upon the row number and the column

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.090
number we are getting a single bit so
error correction code can be very much

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:57.070
applicable on these on this and you can
do the corrections we can further go for

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.700
the rejections we can go for the
collections individually for each if

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.210
every bit that is not possible here
because you are getting all these bits

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.820
in a bulk and the last one is that the
main difference I'm going to

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:15.490
tell you for most of the ROM circuits
we go for this 2d organization and in

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.870
the current trend in the most of the RAM
circuits will be going for two and half

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.250
D memory organization so that is the
issue so two and half D memory

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:30.160
organization for most of the RAM
circuits and 2D organization for

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.070
most of the your ROM circuits so this is
the memory chip organization so in this

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.920
particular session we have discussed 2d
and 2 and Half D the memory organization in

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.290
case of 2d all the address bits will be
applicable to the input of this column

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:52.390
sorry row wise decoder here the address
bits will be divided into two parts and

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.770
some of them will be applicable to the
row wise decoder and some of them will

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.610
be applicable to the column wise decoder
respectively a single cell will be

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.080
selected from the single cell I shall be
getting a single bit in or out depending

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.450
upon the read write mode through this
bit  and bit outlines and in this way

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.910
this sort of circuits will be working in
parallel for the multiple bits word size

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.590
so I think that your conception is
cleared draw these circles you know the

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:27.210
exam copies if such question come in
future thanks for watching
