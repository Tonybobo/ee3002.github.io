00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.930
introduction to lab 14 semiconductor

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.490
memory in this video we'll explore the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.910
concept of memory and the different

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.620
types you will encounter in this class

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.710
memory is a type of circuit used to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.750
store electronic data memory cells are

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.260
tiny circuits existing in a larger chip

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.789
that store one bit of binary data each

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.800
the chips that exist in the multi sim

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.680
platform are able to store thousands of

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.289
bits worth of data memory chips can

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.210
usually read and write writing is a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.000
process where data is stored in groups

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.520
of memory cells called words words

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.770
consist of bits ^ 2 ie

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.629
2 4 8 16 bits etc each word has a memory

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.280
address which acts like a marker so that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
they can be identified when they need to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.190
be read when a chip reads it recalls the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.289
data stored in a word there are

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.300
increasing technologies and methods that

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.079
exist to reduce the time needed to read

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.640
data for example the memory in CDs can

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.949
only be read in the order in which it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.320
was written even though this process

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.990
takes a matter of nanoseconds others are

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.270
even more efficient some of the newer

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.729
technologies include RAM random access

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.330
memory which can be both written read

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.979
and the memory accessed in any order

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.619
some forms of semiconductor memory can

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.520
only be read and not written these are

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.490
known as read-only memory or ROM some

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
examples of roms are proms programmable

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.270
read-only memory and eeproms

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.570
electrically erasable programmable

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.009
read-only memory in this lab you will

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.869
explore the functions of a word

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.009
generator and how these influence the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.009
functionality of RAM
