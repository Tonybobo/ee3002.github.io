00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.180
So this is the circuit of three transistor
D Ram why 3 transistor diagram. You can see we

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.040
we have three transistor M1 M2 and M3. All right.
Now, let's see overall view of this circuit

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.089
first, we have the bit and bit bar lines.
So this are the two lines.Now. This can act

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:23.449
as input lines or output lines.Then we have
the read and write lines.Now. This is a similar

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.710
type of word line. What word line did
it can be 1 or 0 similarly read line and write.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.860
line can be 1 or 0 then we have the pre-charge
capacitors. Now this are the pre-charged capacitor

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.640
already charged. Right? Then we have this capacitor
Cs so this is basically is the main part

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.080
of the memory, right? We are going to write
here like the x is the main part we are going

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.670
to write here and we are going to read from
here. So this area we will use to write in

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.360
X and this area we will use to read from the
X. So this is the basic meaning of the overall circuit.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.729
So first let's see the write operation.So
the very first step involved in this is we

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.380
have to make the right line as one simple.
So if we make the right line as one

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.880
this means that we have to make the read line
as 0 if we do that what will happen. Let's

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.340
see that if this is 1 then this would be on
so second point is M1 would be on right only

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.850
M1 is connected to this line. This means
that really zero. This means that M3 is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.560
off because it is connected to it. Similarly
M3 is off and here you can see M2 is also

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.249
off so M2 and M3 are off now. Let's see the
further part. Now, you know that this area

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.889
is off. It is gone.Then what we have to do
we have to focus on this area.Now.This is

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:54.369
very simple now in this area we have only
the bed line. And we have the capacitor and

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.060
we have this stored capacitor, right? So you
already know that C1 is pre-charged. So the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.920
value we know that it is charged VDD right
and bit now. This is the important part whether

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.390
it would be input or it would be output.Now.
That is the question. It is very simple what

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.959
you are doing write operation. We have to
write in this x surely. This would be input

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.549
because we are placing here one or we can
place here zero.So output it is not present

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:31.050
here. So this line would act as input simple.
So next point is bit line is acting as input

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.010
line.Now, this is charged. This is the input
line now if you place here the one so what

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.450
will happen. So here we have VDD now to overcome
this transistor this transistor have some

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.060
VTN  that is known as the threshold voltage of this transistor. You can simply look at

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.530
this.So suppose.This is the threshold voltage
VTN  if you have to make so this is the on

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.719
area and this is the off If you have to overcome,
all right, if you have to make this transistor

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:11.560
on you have to overcome VTN so this is what
we are doing. So here we have VTN. So the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:19.421
overall voltage here would be VDD minus VTN Because it requires some voltage VTN here and

00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:24.959
here so it will consume VTN.So we are subtracting
VTN from it because after VTN this transistor

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:33.959
would be on and the value of x is now VDD
minus VTN  Simple so this was the calculation

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:42.310
here that the X stores VDD minus VTN now
if now this is possible when bit is 1 correct.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.480
Now if bit line is 0 then the value of x is
0 simple.So now let's take a quick recap what

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.940
we have done in write operation first.We made
the write as 1 and write as 0 if we make this this

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.810
means that this transistor is on this both
are off. So this area is gone and this area

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.519
is present in this area. We are using bit
as the input line and the capacitor

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.370
here is already pre charged to VDD
Now this voltage depends on whether it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.609
is 1 or 0 if it is 1 with the voltage here
is VDD if it is 0 the voltage here is 0 then

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.510
we are checking the value of x if this is
VDD  it would take some VTN value to come here.So

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.490
x value would be VDD minus VTN and when bit
line is 1 now when bit line is 0 x value is

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.010
0 now. We have to know that if this is Is
1 this will obviously be 0 and if this is

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.250
0 this obviously would be 1 so that is the
next point that is what is the effect on bit

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.259
bar.If this is 1 this would be forced to 0
if this is 0 this would be forced to one now

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:53.460
after doing this what we do is
we make W line as 0 so we have successfully

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.460
write the value of x in this cell. So this
was the write  operation now, let's move on

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.949
to the read operation now. Talk about the
read operation. Now. This is a very simple

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.330
operation first point.We have to note that
read lines should be 1 read line should be

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.250
1 this means that write line should be 0
because we are doing the read operation. Now

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.960
when this is 1 this means that M3 is on right
you can see a direct connection M3 is on and

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.240
W is 0 this means that M1 is off.
So second point is also very simple third

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:35.360
Point read is one. This is on the value. Here
of C2 is VDD because it is Pre- Charge. So the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.319
bit lines that is the bit bar line has the
value here as VDD.So the third point is it

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:50.020
is pre-charged the bit bar value here is VDD
So C2 is recharged. And now four point this

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.849
is on now the whole case depends here. Now.What
is that is the fourth point if x value is

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.009
VDD minus VTN if this is the case then
M2 would be on If M2 is on and M3 is on and

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.850
the voltage here is VDD  you can see that
it capacitor will discharge and the voltage

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:22.000
here would be decreased. Right? So this is
the flow where it would discharge to ground

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.570
and the voltage here will decrease now It
means that the bit bar voltage so bit bar

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:37.770
voltage tends to 0 and this is sent to sense
amplifier. And it says that if this is happening

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.990
that bit bar value is decreasing to zero sense
amplifier will see that the output is 1 so

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:54.389
in this way we can read from the cell What
is the output? Suppose if x was 0 then what

00:06:54.389 --> 00:07:02.590
will happen if x is 0 this would be off if
this is off then the bit bar has the voltage

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.830
VDD and it does not have any way to discharge
right the capacitor don't have any way to

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.370
discharge. So the value will VDD will remain
as it is. This means that the bit bar voltage

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.750
will remain as it is and the sense amplifier
will say if the voltage is as it is out. Output

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.379
is equal to 0 so in this simple way we can
read this. So let's take a quick recap. What

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:31.379
we have done is read line is 1 write line is
0 second.If this is 1 what will happen in

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:36.190
M3 is on and this is 0 what will happen
M1 is of then we are using the pre charged

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:45.250
capacitor. So the voltage here we have is
VDD then M2 is on when X is VDD minus VTN

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:51.580
so this is the important player here if x
is VDD minus VTN  M2 is on if X is 0 M2 is

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:58.280
off so if it is on then capacitor has a way
to discharge if this is off capacitor don't

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:05.599
have any way to discharge and the voltage
will be VDD remain as it is. So the bit bar

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:13.729
line again, it can tend to 0 or it can remain
to one. So if capacitor don't discharge,

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:18.860
then there is no way that bit bar will lose
its voltage. If it doesn't lose its voltage.This

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.389
means that bit bar is similar to one this means
output is 0 if capacitor discharge, then bit

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:29.479
bar will lose its voltage.That means that
bit bar will tends to 0 and then sense amplifier

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:38.640
will say that output is one done
