00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.030
Now the second point is write operation now
this is a very important point. So, please

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.100
take a special care. So the first point is
let's say the memory has the value zero. This

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.380
means that Q is 0 Q Bar is one second point
is word line is 1 now why this is one because

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.440
we have to access this lines. Right third
point is bit and bit bar is 0 sorry bit

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.210
and bit bar is input. Now we have to write
into the memory.So this line should be the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.640
input line. Now. The fourth point is because
it is input line. I have the control over

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.739
this line so I have made this bit bar to  ground
now your question.Is why I have made this

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.190
bit bar line as ground. So the answer for this
is you can note that Q Bar is one and this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.780
is ground now bit bar is ground. Now there
would be a voltage difference. So this will

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.719
discharge now fifth point is voltage decreases.Now
when voltage is decreasing you can note here

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.892
this two transistor will be affected. Now.
The tricky part is fifth point is very tricky.Now

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:12.270
the tricky part is if voltage is less than
threshold voltage of M2.What will happen if

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.970
this is possible.This means that this would
be off if this is off then this would be on

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:27.811
so if M2 is off M1 would be on when M1 is on this means that the output is 1 so

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:35.760
you can note that Q was Zero but I have made
Q is equal to 1 now we have write successfully

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.520
in the memory. So let's take a quick recap.
The main part to change Q is equal to 0 to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.560
Q equal to 1 was this forcing this bit bar
line to ground why we have to force because there

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.660
would be a voltage difference current will
flow voltage will decrease and voltage decreases

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.400
then threshold voltage of M2 transistor.Then
we are in profit why we are in profit because

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.750
we have successfully changed that M2 is off.
This means that  M1 is on when  M1 is on means

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.349
that it will get the value Q will get the
value of VDD so you will get the value

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.939
of VDD means Q is equal to 1 so we have changed
Q is equal to 0 to Q is equal to 1. Now the

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.930
third point was the design consideration.
Now this happens in the read operation. You

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.340
might have one question. Let's say Q is 0
and q bar is 1 So when pre charged capacitor

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.860
this means that VDD and 0 the voltage difference
capacitor will discharge.All right capacitor

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.930
will discharge that's right.But the problem
here is voltage is increasing here as well

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.000
as voltage is increasing here.Now. The question
is if voltage increases then what will happenif

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.280
voltage is greater than threshold voltage
of M4 what will happen M4 would be on

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.319
M4 is on then what will happen Q Bar
is 0 now Q is zero at the same time Q Bar

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:06.459
is also 0 because of this. Now this is the
problem. So you have to make sure that Voltage

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.750
is not greater.So this condition is not true.
So you have to make sure when there is a voltage

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.019
difference and capacitor discharge capacitor
discharge that's okay, that's cool, but it should

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.909
not the voltage here will increase as well
as the voltage here will increase you have

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:30.090
to make sure that the voltage here does not does not exceed the VTN of M4

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.629
if it exceeds the VTN of M4 what will
happen M4 would be on when M4 is on this means

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.659
that Q Bar is 0 Q Bar is 0 means Q Bar is
also 0 and Q is also 0 this means this is

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:51.629
the read's condition which is not true and
this will affect
