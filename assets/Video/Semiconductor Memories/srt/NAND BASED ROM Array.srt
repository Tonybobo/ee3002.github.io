1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:11,210
Nand based ROM Array when one input is low on
row 2 ,3 and 4 inputs are high

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,310
when the row input is low the N Mos
transistor corresponding to Row 1 in

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,900
column 2 or 4 will be turned off
therefore column 2 and column 4

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,550
outputs will be tied to VDD since Row 2
3 and 4 inputs are high the N Mos

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,370
transistor in column 1 and 3
correspondent to row 2 ,3 and 4 will be turn

6
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,329
on therefore column 1 and column 3
outputs will be tied to low row 2 input

7
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:50,760
is low row 1 3 and 4 inputs
are high when the row 2input is low the

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,280
N Mo's transistor correspondent row 2in
column 3 and 4 will be turned off

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,879
therefore column 3 and column 4
outputs will be tied to VDD since row

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,100
1 3 and 4 inputs are high the N Mo's
transistor in column 1 and 2

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,979
corresponding to Row 1 3 and 4 will be
turn on therefore column 1 and column

12
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,900
2 outputs will be tie to low row 3 input is low and row 1 2 and 4 inputs

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,700
are high when the row 3 input is low
the N Mos transistor correspondent or

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,799
row 3 in column 1 and 4 will be turned
off therefore column 1 and column 4

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,390
outputs will be tied to VDD since Row
1 2 and 4 inputs are high the N Mo's

16
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,970
transistor in column 2 and 3
corresponding to Row 1 2 and 4 will be

17
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,869
turn on therefore column 2 and column
3 outputs will be tie to low row 4

18
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:02,850
input is low and row 1 2 and 3 inputs
are high when the row for input is low

19
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,670
the N Mo's transistor corresponding to
Row 4 in column 2 and 3 will be turned

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,550
off therefore column 2 and column 3
outputs will be tied to VDD

21
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,739
since row 1 , 2and 3 inputs are
high the N Mos transistor in column 1

22
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,709
and 4 correspond in row 1, 2and
3

23
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:29,849
will be turn on therefore column 1 and
column 4 outputs will be tie to low

24
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,860
in another words to determine the column
outputs we can first to attach a row

25
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,360
with low input followed by checking the
presence or absence of an N Mos

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,630
transistor in the columns corresponding
to the row with low input the column

27
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,610
output will be high if the row input is
low and then N Mos transistor are present

28
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,549
in the column the column output will be
low if the row input is low and N Mos

29
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:01,769
transistor are absent in the column
