Hello friends, Today topic is DRAM what is the full form of dynamic Random

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,830
Access Memory first you will see working of 1T.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:19,570
That is one transistor DRAM  then we will see 3 Transistor DRAM. So let's start  so let's go for the first one

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,930
That is one transistor DRAM. so let's see this circuit first.

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,390
To draw this circuit. First we need the first word line.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,030
Then we need the data line dot means connection is present here i have not draw any dots

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,640
so there is no connection.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,950
so here we have connection that we are using access transistor so access transistor  is this let's say M .

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:52,000
Then we have one capacitor this will  store the charges right and then we will have one more

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,470
capacitor.

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,650
This is circuit of one transistor DRAM

12
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,910
You can see only one transistor. so what is the working let's see that the first point

13
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:11,940
what we have is  a read  operation in read operation, you have to understand this that we are making this capacitor equals to VDD by two.

14
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:20,900
so this is re charge to VDD by 2 and now why VDD by 2 ? it will be understood in futher steps so the second part is if word line is one

15
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:27,900
what will happen if this is one then this transistor will be on so M = on.

16
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,700
if this is on this capacitor can check its voltage with dataline if this is on

17
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,689
If the capacitor has voltage, it will be shared

18
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:43,980
if the voltage is 0 it will be shared to this line

19
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:50,560
now we have to understand that since VL is VDD by 2  so here we have VDD by 2

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,180
and second point is if Word line is one . this transistor is on

21
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,600
and we don't know whether the voltage here is 1/0 if it is one

22
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:09,820
if voltage is present higher then if Cs has
has the voltage of one then what will happen the voltage

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:18,700
would be shared here and collector voltage will be greater than VDD by two 
if this is the voltage of Data line

24
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,260
and if it is send to sense amplifier

25
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,080
What will happen?

26
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,360
Yes the sense Amplifier will say that the output is 1 so this is the flow lets take a quick recap

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,840
first we have to make this capacitor as VDD by 2. Secondly, we have to use the access transistor

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,689
Now to use the access transistor. Word line should be one. so if word line is one. M is on now if M is on all the gain  depend on

29
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:46,689
Cs capacitor.

30
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:57,480
If there is a charge or let's say there is a voltage of one  then it will share the voltage here at this point since the voltage here is VDD by 2  and if it  share

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
the voltage.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:07,360
The collector voltage would be greater than VDD by 2 and if this is present at the data line then it is send to sense amplifier futher

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,730
now this sense amplifier will say if the data line voltage is greater than VDD by 2 then the output is one

34
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:24,909
what if the voltage is less than VDD by 2 then this sense amplifier will say output is equal to zero and after doing this it will
refresh the cell

35
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:30,800
so we have to refresh this cell so this is the read operation

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,820
now let's move to write operation

37
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,760
so the second point we have is the write operation now we have to understand

38
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,120
in read operation, this data line acted as the output

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,560
so in write operation, this data line will act as input line. Now if this is the input line

40
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,879
We can place one or zero here. if we place one

41
00:03:50,879 --> 00:04:02,339
This means that this capacitor would have the value 1. so this capacitor will be charged if we place a zero here then what will happen this capacitor will be discharged

42
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:07,820
so the value will be 0 so this is simple Data line will be acted as input line

43
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,720
Then word line should be 1 so we can access this transistor

44
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,440
because we can access this transistor that is if this is one we can access this capacitor

45
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:24,500
now so word line is one this mean that we 
can access this capacitor now

46
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,840
and if word line is one then the voltage share

47
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,040
will be data line is one. Capacitor will have the voltage VDD

48
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,580
And if data line is zero then capacitor will 
have the voltage zero.

49
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,550
So this is charging

50
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:47,400
this is discharge simple?
