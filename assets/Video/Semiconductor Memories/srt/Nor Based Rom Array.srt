1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:11,940
Nor Based ROM Array when row 1 input is
high in row 2 3 & 4 inputs are low when

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,100
the row input is high the N Mos
transistor corresponding to row 1 in

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,930
column 1 and 3 will be turned on
therefore column 1 and column 3 outputs

4
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,670
will be tie to low since row 2,  3 and
4 inputs are low the N Mo's transistor

5
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:36,270
in column 2 and 4 corresponding to Row 2
3 & 4 will be turned off therefore

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,910
column two and column 4 outputs will be
tied to VDD

7
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:49,640
row 2 input is high and row 1 3 & 4
inputs are low when the row 2 input is

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,600
high the N Mo's transistor correspondent
row 2 in column 1 and 2 will be turn om

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,100
therefore column 1 and column 2 outputs
will be tie to low

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,500
since row 1 3 & 4 inputs are low 
N Mos transistor in column 3 & 4

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,640
corresponding to Row 1 3 & 4 will be
turned off

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,540
therefore column 3 and column 4 outputs
will be tie to VDD Row 3 input is high

13
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:27,270
Row 1 2 & 4 inputs are low
when the row 3 input is high the N Mos

14
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,299
Mo's transistor corresponding to row 3
in column 2 & 3 will be turn on

15
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:38,759
therefore column two and column 3
outputs will be tie to low since row 1

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,640
2 & 4 inputs are low the N Mo's
transistor in column 1 & 4 corresponding

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,820
to Row 1 2 & 4 will be turned off
therefore column 1 and column 4 outputs

18
00:01:50,820 --> 00:02:00,439
will be tied to VDD  row 4 input is
high and row  1 2 & 3 inputs are low

19
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,360
when the row 4 input is high the N
Mo's transistor corresponding  to row 4

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,190
in column 1 and 4 will be turn on
therefore column 1 and column 4

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,000
outputs will be tie to low since row
1 2 and 3 inputs are low the N

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Mo's transistor in column 2 and 3
corresponding to row 1 2 and 3 will

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,830
be turned off therefore column 2 and
column 3 outputs will be tied to VDD

24
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,190
in another words to determine the
column outputs we can first to look at

25
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,930
row with high input followed by checking
the presence or absence of n Mo's

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,200
transistor in the columns corresponding
to the row with high input the column

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,730
output will be low if the row input is
high and then N Mos transistor are

28
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,400
present in the column the column output
will be high if the row input is high

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,489
and then N Mos transistor are absent in
the column
