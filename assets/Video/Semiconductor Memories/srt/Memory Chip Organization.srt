1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,690
these sessions topic is memory chip
organization how the memory it may be

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,179
RAM may be ROM how this memory have
got fabricated how these chip

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,789
organizations are being made so actually
we are having two categories for that

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,010
one is a 2d organization and the another is the 2 and half D organization

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,330
so let me discuss them one by one I'm
having the suitable diagram with me so I

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,430
shall discuss with my diagrams so now
this is my 2d organization and this one

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,000
is my 2 and half D  the organization and
what are the advantages disadvantages

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,100
where I should go for 2d and 2 and half D organization
I should discuss everything here in this

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,700
session so now you see this is a decoder
let us suppose it is having 3 bits as

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,380
input you know that decoder is the
combinational circuit which will have n

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,000
number of input lines including the
power of n number of output lines and

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,640
depending upon the combination of the
input one of the output lines will be

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,590
selected at a time that that is the
basic and fundamental logic of a decoder

14
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,090
circuit so here we are having 3 input
lines and we are having eight output

15
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,040
lines at here so depending upon the
input bit combination one of the output

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,689
lines will be enabled and with the
particular output line we're having say

17
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,700
eight vertical lines we were having say in
eight vertical lines are there so now what

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,490
will happen so it might be eight might
be sixteen might be 24 so that is not

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,909
dependent on this decoder side so the
word that means word means the number of

20
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,470
bits in this particular line will be
coming out through this i/o circuit

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,630
whether the bits will be coming out or
going in obviously that will be decided

22
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,960
by this control line read or write so if
the control line is enable for read then

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,700
the data will be coming out through the
data to the data lines and if it is

24
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,890
writes then it'll be going in to the
respective word to be written to get

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,780
overwritten so that is the issue so
we're here we are having to develop of n

26
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,950
number of words if we have n
of select lines in this decoders input

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,740
so 2 ^ n number of words and you can
have M number of N and M they are not

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,590
related so M number of output lines
through this column IO circuit we know

29
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,900
that for the memory read and memory
write we are having two registers one is

30
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,900
called memory address registered in
short MAR and the other one is your memory

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:45,370
data registered in short it is MDR while
performing read operation MAR will be

32
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,530
containing the address from the MAR the
address will be coming to the decoder

33
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,209
input the respective world will get
selected depending upon the combination

34
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,950
and the output does obtained if I select
it in the read mode will be coming to

35
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,940
the MDR  memory data register in case
of memory write the MAR will be

36
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,890
containing the target memory locations
address so from the address from the

37
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,360
address register that means from the
MAR  memory address register the address

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,190
will be coming to the decoders input
respective word will get selected and

39
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:27,100
here I shall put the right control mode
enabled and then these data lines

40
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,390
through these data lines the respective
bits will be going to the respective

41
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,090
word to get written so in this way the
memory read and memory write will take

42
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,440
place for 2d organization
so let us come to the 2 and half D next

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,760
so in cases of 2 and half D organization
we are having the same kind of scenario

44
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,859
but here we are having some column bits
so in the column also we are having one

45
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:56,380
decoder so in the column also we are
having one decoder not the column IO

46
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,340
circuit so depending upon the bits in
the input and depending upon the bits in

47
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,079
this particular decoders input so one of
the output lines will get selected and

48
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,769
one of the output lines will get
selected let us suppose it will select

49
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,479
this particular cell to select this
particular cell so this line has got

50
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,250
enabled and say this line has got
enabled so this particular location has

51
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,630
got selected so from that very location
I should

52
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,300
that it is a bit position  at
the junction of these two one is the one

53
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,110
is the row line row line another one is
the column line so at the intersection

54
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,730
we are having one bit
so at that very bit position this

55
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,020
read/write control line will decide
whether I am writing then through

56
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,400
between the bit will come and that will
be written here if this control line

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,360
selects I'll be going for the reading
operation then from this bit the data

58
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,100
will be coming out that data bit will be
coming out to this bit output line so

59
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,280
what will happen each and every location
will contain a single bit so now how

60
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,160
many words do require how many bits of
word per location 64 so 64 such

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,170
parallel circuits will be working 32 32
such parallel circuits will be working

62
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,390
so now let us go for the comparisons
here the number of column output lines

63
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,910
are fixed hardware fixed but here how
many bits were going to get against a

64
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,200
single word that we shall we shall
decide because that number of circuits

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,570
will be working in parallel and here you
see the full address bits will be

66
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,850
divided into two part so this is some
bits will be coming down here some bits

67
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,500
will be coming down here so say we are
having 6 bits address so 3 bits here and

68
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,400
3 bits here
so six bits means how many combinations

69
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,060
6 bits means 64 combinations so 3 bits
means how many rows 8 rows 3 bits means

70
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:01,440
how many columns 8 columns so 8 rows and
8 columns so how many Junction points 64

71
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,880
so in this way you are getting the 64
but here all the 6 bits will be

72
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,260
applicable here so 64 horizontal lines
will be coming out so it will it will be

73
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,760
equating more complicated hardware
compared to this one so that is one

74
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,380
advantage second advantage here you see
I told you that it will be

75
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,020
requiring less Hardware less circuitry
less geeks next advantage point is

76
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,640
that here in this particular circuit as
we are having lesser number of hard

77
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,480
words and
logic gates and so on so the pin the IC

78
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,190
pin will be lesser number so easy to
implement easy to implement easy to

79
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,990
fabricate and next one is that here we
are getting from each and every circuit

80
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,140
we are getting a single bit depending
upon the row number and the column

81
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,090
number we are getting a single bit so
error correction code can be very much

82
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,070
applicable on these on this and you can
do the corrections we can further go for

83
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,700
the rejections we can go for the
collections individually for each if

84
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,210
every bit that is not possible here
because you are getting all these bits

85
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:09,820
in a bulk and the last one is that the
 main difference I'm going to

86
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,490
tell you for most of the ROM circuits
we go for this 2d organization and in

87
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,870
the current trend in the most of the RAM
circuits will be going for two and half

88
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,250
D memory organization so that is the
issue so two and half D memory

89
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,160
organization for most of the RAM
circuits and 2D organization for

90
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,070
most of the your ROM circuits so this is
the memory chip organization so in this

91
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,920
particular session we have discussed 2d
and 2 and Half D the memory organization in

92
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,290
case of 2d all the address bits will be
applicable to the input of this column

93
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,390
sorry row wise decoder here the address
bits will be divided into two parts and

94
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,770
some of them will be applicable to the
row wise decoder and some of them will

95
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,610
be applicable to the column wise decoder
respectively a single cell will be

96
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,080
selected from the single cell I shall be
getting a single bit in or out depending

97
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,450
upon the read write mode through this
bit  and bit outlines and in this way

98
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:15,910
this sort of circuits will be working in
parallel for the multiple bits word size

99
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,590
so I think that your conception is 
cleared draw these circles you know the

100
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:27,210
exam copies if such question come in
future thanks for watching
