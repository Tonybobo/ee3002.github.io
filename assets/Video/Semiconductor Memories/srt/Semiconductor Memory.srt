00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,930
introduction to lab 14 semiconductor

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,490
memory in this video we'll explore the

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,910
concept of memory and the different

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,620
types you will encounter in this class

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,710
memory is a type of circuit used to

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,750
store electronic data memory cells are

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,260
tiny circuits existing in a larger chip

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,789
that store one bit of binary data each

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,800
the chips that exist in the multi sim

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,680
platform are able to store thousands of

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,289
bits worth of data memory chips can

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,210
usually read and write writing is a

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,000
process where data is stored in groups

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,520
of memory cells called words words

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,770
consist of bits ^ 2 ie

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,629
2 4 8 16 bits etc each word has a memory

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,280
address which acts like a marker so that

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,340
they can be identified when they need to

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,190
be read when a chip reads it recalls the

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,289
data stored in a word there are

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,300
increasing technologies and methods that

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,079
exist to reduce the time needed to read

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,640
data for example the memory in CDs can

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,949
only be read in the order in which it

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,320
was written even though this process

26
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,990
takes a matter of nanoseconds others are

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,270
even more efficient some of the newer

28
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,729
technologies include RAM random access

29
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,330
memory which can be both written read

30
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,979
and the memory accessed in any order

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:22,619
some forms of semiconductor memory can

32
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,520
only be read and not written these are

33
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:29,490
known as read-only memory or ROM some

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,520
examples of roms are proms programmable

35
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,270
read-only memory and eeproms

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,570
electrically erasable programmable

37
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,009
read-only memory in this lab you will

38
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,869
explore the functions of a word

39
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,009
generator and how these influence the

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,009
functionality of RAM
