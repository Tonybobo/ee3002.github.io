1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,870
here's another example of feedback we're
gonna look at the ideal amplifier where

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,240
the gain is to find us A one ro of
this amplifier is zero and  Rid

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,350
differential input resistance is
infinite so because of that we're only

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:24,000
going to look at the AF which is going
to be the feedback gain so identify

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,080
first the type we have I-s is my input Io is my output so it's going to be

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,489
a shunt series

7
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,470
the next part is to identify the
feedback portion RL is not in the

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,310
feedback portion and I-s my input
so here's my feedback part so out of the

9
00:00:53,310 --> 00:01:03,150
feedback portion I want to redraw it and
find R11 R22 and beta I look at the

10
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,370
locations it's connected to the rest of
the circuit here's my input side and

11
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,350
here at this location is my output side
so those are the two locations that I'm

12
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,270
going to modify looking in here I look
at the type I have out which is series

13
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,940
so I leave this side open and find the
equivalent Network which is R2 plus R

14
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:35,700
in this case on this one I look in this
side for R22 and I have a shunt on the

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:44,450
input side so I short this so R22 is
going to be R in parallel with R2 to

16
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:51,390
find beta you draw again the same
network you identify what your input

17
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,240
sources and your output so they're both
currents with an input current I put

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:06,240
this as I-f with it going in and I draw
Io at the same location it's

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,750
connected to the rest of it here also
going in and beta is defined as I-f over

20
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:20,670
Io so I need to put these two in
terms of each other here I see that this

21
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,100
is a current in this branch I have a
current and it's going in as a divider

22
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,950
so I can use a current divider to find
this I can say that I-f is equal to a

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,730
negative Io branch opposite which
would be R over the summation of both I

24
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,410
can take Io and I get  I-f over Io for beta

25
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,340
again this is beta feed back hoping a
feedback

26
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,540
so now I'm going to redraw the circuit
up here I disconnect the feedback

27
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,200
portion and I replace in the same
location it was before on this side I

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:16,660
replace R22 and at this location I
replace it with R11 going in here was

29
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:22,870
positive to negative the end and I
replace this with the ideal one which is A

30
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:36,010
1 times Vn so now I want to find write
these values R2 plus R and this one was

31
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:51,120
are in parallel with R2 and beta feed
is a minus R over R2 plus R

32
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,520
okay so now I need to get an equation I
want to find from this circuit A which

33
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:14,860
will be Io over I-s so I need to
get Io Io will be Vin over

34
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:23,290
the resistances RL plus R in parallel
with R2 and Vin is here so writing

35
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,250
the in in terms of I-s I-s will come in
here

36
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:34,660
but then this is negative so I have a
negative I-s R2 plus R so I plug

37
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:46,060
that in and get Io over I-s as A1
negative R2 plus R and I've divided by

38
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:57,490
the I-s all over  RL plus R in parallel
with R2 so now to find AF

39
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:14,800
I use this value for A this is my value
for A may rewrite it up here so I small

40
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,040
room

41
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:49,740
and then it's one plus A again multiplied
by beta feed so the two negatives will

42
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,590
cancel and become a positive so this
cancels was this negative and I get R

43
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:03,140
over R2 plus R and that is my value for
AF
