1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:07,710
here we see a feedback circuit so the
first step is to identify the input and

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:16,680
the output it's seen here that the input
is a current source and the output is a

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:27,840
voltage source so this is going to be a
shunt shunt type network after

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,170
identifying the type of feedback the
next step is to identify the feedback

5
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,790
portion of the network
here we see from the output to the input

6
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,210
side here's the output side here is an
input side that we have our Rf is our

7
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:53,090
feedback portion so to find the next
step which is our R11 and R22 and beta

8
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:00,629
we're going to look at the feedback
portion only to look at R11 we have to

9
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,630
look at this side of the network which
is going to be a shunt so we're going to

10
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:18,630
ground that side and R11 is going to
be our Rf for R22 again we draw the

11
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,130
feedback portion and we look at this
side of it and then we refer back to the

12
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,450
type and it's a shunt so again we short
shunt and we open a series we leave it

13
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:45,869
open so this is again going to be our RF
for R22 now for beta we draw the

14
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,020
network again and for beta on the output
side we put the type of output it is in

15
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,130
this case it's Vo so we place Vo on this side it's a current so we

16
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:09,179
place a short for the current and we
call this I-f  beta is defined as I-f

17
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,619
over Vo

18
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,000
so putting I-f  in terms of Vo
it's going in this direction so it's

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:31,370
negative so we have I-f is equal to a
negative Vo over Rf so to get this

20
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,840
in terms of I-f over Vo we'll
divide here and this ends up being a

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:47,020
minus 1 over Rf as the value for the
feedback so now that we have those three

22
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:53,450
components we can redraw the small
signal version of this removing the

23
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,200
feedback portion and placing in now this
R11 at the input side R22 at the

24
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,720
output side and then we use the
equations for this beta which is beta

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,980
feed back so I'm going to call it beta
feed here and redrawing this with the

26
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,910
small signal circuit

27
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:32,430
I'm going to short this capacitor which
is large for this is my input side so

28
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,130
I'm going to place our R11 here

29
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:54,540
the source site is grounded so remember
this is gate source and drain and I'm

30
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,600
going to also include ro and then this
is an ideal current source so that

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,880
becomes an open and this is my output
side so I put R22 here and

32
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:18,150
this is my Vo so from this this is
my new A circuit I want to gather three

33
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,989
pieces of information I want to know the
gain which is going to be Vo over

34
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:30,090
I -s which will be my A value the
open-loop gain value A I want to know Ri

35
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:40,500
which will include Rs and I want to know
ro which will include RL in this case

36
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:52,590
there is no RL so my ro will be at this
location and my Ri will be here and then

37
00:04:52,590 --> 00:05:02,970
the A gain will be from Vo to I-s so
now I want to analyze this circuit so I

38
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:10,200
need to get Vo in terms of I-s so Vo can be written as a minus the

39
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,490
current minus g-m vgs times these two in
parallel so ro and parallel with R22

40
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:25,380
which is Rf so I'm going to just put
those values as Rf and here is also Rf

41
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:35,820
now Vgs is a current source in so I
times R will give me the G and I notice

42
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,480
that Vs is ground so Vgs will be just
VG remember that if it's not you also

43
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:50,610
have to find the Vs value and get Vgs
which is VG minus Vs so Vgs in this

44
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,800
case then was I-s times Rs and parallel
with Rf

45
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,800
and I can plug that in here and then
divide by I-s to get Vo over I-s

46
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:16,420
which is my A as A minus g-m ro in
parallel with Rf x Rs in parallel with

47
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:30,040
Rf so now I have my A value i can also
write Ri and Rf ro so Ri

48
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:39,040
remember this includes Rs will be Rs
in parallel with Rf and ro which is here

49
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:49,570
is on the top of the dependent source so
it's gonna be ro in parallel with Rf so

50
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,230
now I have these three values I'm going
to use the feedback equations with the

51
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:03,850
amount of feedback for Ro and Ri
the amount of feedback whether I divide

52
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:09,040
or multiply depends on the type of
network I have for shunt type we're

53
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,530
gonna always divide by 1 over or 1 over
the amount of feedback and for series

54
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,360
it's always a multiplication so since
both of these are shunt on both sides

55
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,820
the input side is shunt the output side
is a shunt they're both going to be

56
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:40,740
divided by the amount of feedback so AF
is going to be A over 1 plus a beta feed

57
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:52,030
just the feedback value minus 1 over RC
so I get A is a minus g-m ro in parallel

58
00:07:52,030 --> 00:08:03,160
with Rf Rs in parallel with Rf
all over 1 plus again this minus a or a

59
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,919
which is a minus GM ro and parallel
with Rf Rs and parallel

60
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:16,030
with RF x the beta feedback which is a
minus 1 over RF so these minuses cancel

61
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:25,199
and give me a positive term so this is
my AF value and this is the feedback

62
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:41,399
gain that we'll have for this particular
circuit now for Ri Rif this includes Rs

63
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm going to divide the Rs in parallel
with Rf which is my Ri value by the

64
00:08:50,680 --> 00:09:01,600
bottom of this which is the amount of
feedback now this includes the RS I do

65
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,890
not want to include the RS for my
overall feedback value so because this

66
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:18,300
is a shunt type to remove the RS the
term we used was Rin this does not

67
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:30,420
include RS we have to take this Rif and
it's usually easier to find the value

68
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:37,269
itself and subtract off the Rs because
it's in shunt that means it's in

69
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:44,860
parallel so I'm going to have to take
this as a parallel form for Ri or

70
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:55,199
Rof it's the same thing
it was ro in parallel with RF divided by

71
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:02,170
the 1 plus a beta feed and so that's
again the same term GM ro in parallel

72
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:12,250
with Rf Rs in parallel with Rf times
1 over Rf since there's no load RL that

73
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:20,319
we factored in there this would be also
Rout for this case if we had an RL

74
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:25,030
included in this
to remove it we again would use one over

75
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:33,330
rof minus 1 over RL to remove it
