1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,290
we're going to talk about the
operational amplifier or op amp for

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,050
short and this is the workhorse of all
analog electronics the operational

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,500
amplifier it's a type of amplifier an
amplifier is is anything that you put an

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,199
electronic signal end and you get out a
larger version of the signal so this

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,119
would be an amplifier with some sort of
gain and if I put a signal X in here

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,660
usually a voltage or a current then the
signal that comes out here is A times X

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,850
and that's what we mean by amplification
and a signal that I've shown here is X

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,230
is anything that we're interested in it
could be a voltage or a current and when

9
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,800
we put it through an amplifier we get a
larger version of it so this is a really

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,600
common activity in electronic design now
when we talk specifically about an

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,770
operational amplifier the symbol for
that we use for an operational amplifier

12
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:05,280
is a triangle and it has two inputs one
is the plus input one is the minus input

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,670
and it has an output and it also has two
power supplies to it there's a some sort

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,590
of plus voltage it goes into it and some
sort of minus voltage so this is the

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,390
abstract symbol for an op-amp so when we
say the word op-amp we have some

16
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:33,689
specific properties in mind one is op
amps have high gain so in this case the

17
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,860
the gain usually with the symbol A is
something like ten to the fifth to ten

18
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,130
to the sixth really really high
another thing we think about when we

19
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,570
talk about op amps is that they're used
for feedback circuits and we'll talk

20
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,020
about feedback in the next couple of
videos and what that means but that's

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,320
the application that we use op amps for
and the third thing that's distinctive

22
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
about op amps is that they have this
this kind of input this kind of input

23
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,289
here is referred to as a differential

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:23,350
input so an op-amp usually has
differential inputs and that's as

25
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:30,000
opposed to something we call a single
ended input which will be just one wire

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,620
and what a differential input means it
says we have we can label the voltages

27
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,900
here we'll call this V out we'll call
this V plus and we'll call this input V

28
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:52,680
minus and differential input means that
V out equals the gain times V plus minus

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:01,270
V minus so the output signal here is
proportional to the difference in the

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,040
voltage between these two signals here

31
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,490
so I want to make a plot of this
equation right here just so we get it a

32
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,870
good idea of what it looks like

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:25,530
and the axes here are V in and V out
where V in specifically equals V plus

34
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:32,250
minus V minus V plus minus V minus
that's the input signal to the op-amp

35
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,200
and we're going to apply the gain factor
to it to get V out so that'll look like

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,480
like this something like this it's going
to be a very steep line and the slope of

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,770
that line the slope of this line is A so
the slope is going to be 10 to the 5th

38
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:54,870
or 10 to the 6 something like that very
very vertical now one of the properties

39
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,709
of this is that V out cannot go above or
below its power supply voltages so on

40
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,570
this plot here that's called saturation
if V out gets up to V plus we say it's

41
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:13,920
saturates and looks like this it goes
flat basically here and here where this

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,859
voltage value here is minus the power
supply and this voltage right here is

43
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,770
the positive power supply but over this
range here over this range in here

44
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:33,090
between those two points is quite linear
it goes through zero and we this is

45
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,580
where we use it most of the time so now
I want to talk a little bit more detail

46
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,690
about what this symbol means here and
what's inside it and how it's actually

47
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,130
connected up in a circuit

48
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:03,260
so we talked about the voltage behavior
of an op-amp this is V Plus V minus and

49
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,690
V out there's one thing more that we
need to know and that is the current

50
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,440
this current right here and this current
right here for an op-amp an ideal op-amp

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,900
is zero no current flows in here so this
op-amp is just sensing the voltages at

52
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,230
these points but no current flows in so
this is the second key property of an

53
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:35,570
op-amp the first one is the voltage
behavior V out equals the gain times V

54
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:43,780
plus minus V minus another way we can
write this is V out equals a times V in

55
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:53,720
where V in of course equals V plus
minus V minus so these are the these are

56
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,320
the two electrical properties that are
going to allow us to analyze these

57
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,090
circuits and the analyzing the circuits
is actually going to be pretty simple so

58
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,270
you're probably wondering like what is
inside here what's going on inside here

59
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:11,090
so what's inside here is somewhere
between 20 and 50 or so transistors and

60
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,130
resistors sometimes capacitors these are
really complex designs and for right now

61
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,090
if we just concentrate on the two
properties that we have here we'll be

62
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,760
able to use these circuits even without
understanding exactly what's inside

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,240
suffice to say it's a differential
amplifier with really high gain and with

64
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,560
just that knowledge we can work out how
these circuits work so let me do a

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,870
couple of more details on how this thing
is actually hooked up so we have a plus

66
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,430
terminal and a minus terminal there's
more terminals on this there's a power

67
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:50,060
supply like this that's plus big V and
there has to be a minus supply typically

68
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:59,240
a - supply - V and let me a ground pin
to be a ground node on here like that

69
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,910
and when this is in a used in a circuit
there'll be over to the side there'll be

70
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,920
two power supplies and this will be 12
volts a 12 volts 12

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:18,710
is a real typical value and there'll be
another one and this is a plus 12 volt

72
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,390
supply as well and they'll be connected
together and this node right between

73
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,820
them will be there our ground node
that's the voltage reference and these

74
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,720
two guys will be hooked up like that the
two power supplies will be hooked up

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,920
this way so with respect to ground this
node is at minus 12 volts and this node

76
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,700
from ground is at plus 12 volts and
ground is right in the middle and when

77
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:57,320
we measure V out we'll measure it with
respect to this ground node so this is

78
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,410
the voltage where we measure plus or
minus V out right there and what we're

79
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,500
going to do is we're going to assume
that all of this stuff is always hooked

80
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,810
up and we're just going to use an even
simpler symbol

81
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,590
just the three terminals like that and
you'll know that all the rest of the

82
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,850
power supplies hooked up that way
and the thing to keep in mind is there's

83
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,260
a large - voltage there's a large plus
voltage and the ground level the ground

84
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,200
node is right in between so positive
voltage is high on the page negative

85
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,300
voltage is low on the page and V out can
go both positive and negative around

86
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,690
ground
so that's your voltage framework to keep

87
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,140
in your head

88
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:53,560
and the op-amp that we've been looking
at has a symbol like this and we know

89
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:02,769
that V out equals some huge gain times V
plus minus V minus so this is a

90
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:10,300
differential input here's V plus here's
V minus one way I think about this is is

91
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:16,389
to look at the way a change in voltage
on the input modifies the output I mean

92
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:27,550
let me label V out here so if there's a
change on the input say V plus goes this

93
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:36,100
way because it's a plus sign that means
that V out goes this way now if I change

94
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:44,649
it over to V minus V minus is on the
negative input if V minus goes up then

95
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,540
V out goes down so that's the
inverting if called the inverting input

96
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,420
and this is called the non-inverting
input so on the non-inverting input up

97
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:02,410
goes up and on the inverting input if
you go up on the inverting input you go

98
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:10,389
in the opposite direction on the output
let's say that the positive input the

99
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:15,970
non-inverting input went down this time
and that means what that means that V

100
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,790
out will go down and just do the same
thing over here I'm gonna run out of

101
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,629
colors let's do the same thing for the
inverting input

102
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:30,850
if the inverting input goes down what
does the what does the output do it goes

103
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,009
up it goes in the opposite direction

104
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,209
that's a way to think about this symbol
when you see it on a schematic page is

105
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:45,189
how do these signals translate through
the device positive non-inverting

106
00:10:45,189 --> 00:10:49,240
signals go in the same direction
inverting signals go in the opposite

107
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,519
directions okay and here's one final
trick I want to share with you something

108
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,510
to be aware of you're going to see a
symbol like this on

109
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:05,950
the page the same op-amp it's the same op in
up but it's written on the page with a

110
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,270
negative with the inverting symbol on
the top and the non-inverting symbol on

111
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:16,240
the bottom so as you look at a schematic
that has an op amp in it one of the

112
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,110
first things you want to do is just
glance and see what order these symbols

113
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,700
are in or is it does it look like that
or does it look like that and keep that

114
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,950
in mind as you're reading the circuit
and trying to understand what it does

115
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,080
okay let's move on and build something
with our op amp
