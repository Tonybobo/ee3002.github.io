from akira hello friends

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:13,259
now here in the chapter number 5 we are
on the step of the numericals of

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,630
negative feedback circuits so before
that we'll have to learn the steps to

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,730
follow the numericals
based on feedback amplifiers so we will

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,289
follow these steps once we follow these
steps with feedback without feedback to

6
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,790
find out input resistance output
resistance all the stuff related with

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,540
their amplifiers and some tricky
problems we'll be discussing in the next

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,250
videos so for that we require these
important steps so let's start with the

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:56,520
steps to follow for the numericals of
negative feedback amplifier let's start

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,899
with the step number one so first of all
step number one is nothing but the

11
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:08,299
identification of the feedback topology

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,640
so in the circuit circuit can be like
anything for example if your voltage

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,250
divider by a C amplifier is given so how
you can identify that whether it is a

14
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,300
first of all whether it is with feedback
or without feedback and then we will

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,070
have to understand that if it is with
feedback then what kind of topology that

16
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,780
we have to use right then and only then
we can get that whether the input

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,860
impedance is increasing or decreasing
output impedance is decreasing or

18
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,240
increasing so based on the sampling and
mixing part we'll get to know that this

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,250
is which feedback topology right so
feedback topology we will have to

20
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:56,479
understand by just knowing the fact that
the at the output side whether voltage is

21
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,820
sampled or current is sample that means
whether it is shunt circuit or a

22
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,259
series circuit if it is shunt  circuit
then I can say that it's nothing but the

23
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,070
voltage sampling if it is a series
circuit then I can say that it is

24
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:16,940
nothing but your current circuit so very
simple trick that I'll give you later on

25
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,180
but right now we will learn particular
circuit related to this feedback

26
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:30,530
amplifiers so if at output
shunt circuit

27
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,650
then I can say that it's nothing but
voltage sampling

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm specifying focusing more on sampling
and mixing part this is because once you

29
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,269
get which sampling and which mixing we can
easily relate that particular topology

30
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:53,000
with sampling and mixing part so here I
will say if at the output shunt circuit

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,140
then it is a voltage sampling if it is a
series circuit then I can say that it's

32
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:06,300
nothing but your current
sampling okay

33
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:14,500
now simply at the output if at input
similarly I will write if it is shunt

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:23,990
circuit then it's a shunt mixing right
if it is series circuit

35
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,780
then it is a 
series mixing

36
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,540
okay I will tell you after this
particular video what are the other  numerical info

37
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,560
current for this voltage series voltage
and current series and currents shunt

38
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,130
as well okay so once you identify this
feedback topology we will have to move

39
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:51,400
further to solve the numerical for
required findings okay one trick that

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,130
you have to understand very carefully

41
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:06,599
take to identify a topology
understand see if

42
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,150
sampling
is

43
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,579
done
at output terminal that means if I'm

44
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:25,360
saying a complete voltage divider bias
C amplifier is there and from the

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,169
output node I have one resistance which
is connected at the input side right so

46
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:39,220
I can say that that will be your voltage
sampling okay so I can say that it's

47
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,530
nothing but your voltage sampling if
sampling is done at  directly at the

48
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,320
output terminal so hey
so whatever sampling I will be getting

49
00:04:50,320 --> 00:05:00,340
that is nothing but voltage sampling
right so we'll take an example we'll say

50
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:08,949
this is particular circuit okay
hey if I have taken this sample from

51
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:15,669
here right this is RF feedback and here
only my output is there right so I can

52
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,889
say that this is nothing but the type of
feedback

53
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:27,030
we're sampling is
is voltage sampling

54
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,410
so if it is voltage sampling this is
very very simple now to understand the

55
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:38,250
feedback topology right now in another
case I can say that if I have

56
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:45,110
this is the voltage and if I'm taking
the feedback from this particular

57
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:53,280
resistance RF okay so I can say that
this is nothing but sampling is current

58
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,050
sampling it's not a voltage so obviously
it will be current sampling sampling is

59
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,710
of current sampling right so this is the
first method that we have to understand

60
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:12,110
for the trick okay as a trick and the
second one is about mixing right if

61
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:24,560
feedback is directly connected to Base
or gate terminal right this is only

62
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,449
related with the this trick is only
related with the FET and BJT amplifiers

63
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,610
so if I'm using the open then that will
not be done for this particular trick

64
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:43,270
okay so this is for FET and BJT
amplifiers okay

65
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,930
in your syllabus only BJT and FET
amplifiers will be there for negative

66
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,680
feedback so if feedback is directly
connected to the base or gate terminal

67
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:59,470
then I can say that it will be a shunt
mixing okay otherwise it will be these

68
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,150
series mixing we will take few examples
later on further after this particular

69
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,120
video we will learn the complete
analysis related to each and every

70
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,560
topologies okay so if feedback is
directly connected to the base and gate

71
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,090
terminal FET BJT for FET BJT amplifier
it will be shunt  mixing

72
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:27,990
otherwise it will be series mixing okay
now we will again take few examples

73
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,670
where we'll get to know that
suppose here I have taken this sample no

74
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,669
matter what sampling is I want to take
the mixing part and

75
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:48,290
this is the input and I have connected
this complete feedback RF feedback

76
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:56,780
circuit directly to base so this will be
your shunt mixing ok so this I will name

77
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,970
it as shunt mixing okay in another sense
I can say if

78
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:11,339
this is your RF okay let's
say this is your output voltage okay

79
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,530
so output voltage is there so this is
your

80
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,720
feedback circuit RF resistance and this
feedback is not directly connected to

81
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,090
the base or gate rather it is connected
with Vs rather I can also say that

82
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:34,289
mathematically Vs is now equal to this
Vi + this VF okay so it's nothing but

83
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:42,570
you are series mixing so we have got
some tricks for that particular

84
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,670
amplifiers to identify what is the
feedback topology that is nothing but

85
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,680
your step number one so let's move
towards the step number two that is

86
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,690
nothing but to draw the circuit without
feedback circuit without feedback

87
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,690
Draw circuit without feedback we must
to know which particular feedback

88
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:10,500
topology I am using okay so for this we
have to draw we have to do some short

89
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,880
circuit we have to do some open circuit
so keep this in mind that I will draw

90
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:22,410
the general diagram again I don't want
the circuit with feedback okay I want

91
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,350
it without feedback okay
so what should I do

92
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:36,670
if the circuit is there itself but in fact
should not be avoided then I can say

93
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:44,730
that I will convert this into your
without feedback circuit and then we

94
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,050
will analyze what is nothing but your
the value of Ri what is nothing but the

95
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:54,570
value of A what is nothing but the value
of Ro and then later on we will divide it

96
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,670
by your the sensitivity factor that is 1
plus AB very simple now let's see

97
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:07,829
this is the B okay let's take an example
of voltage series negative feedback in

98
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:12,829
voltage series for voltage series i am saying

99
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:20,440
for voltage series output  what will
be your circuit circuit is shunted an

100
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:28,100
input  your circuit is series so
this is shunt series right so if I am

101
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,860
saying I don't want this feedback right
I have to convert to my this particular

102
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,269
remaining amplifier circuit at the input
side as well as output side so to have

103
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:45,470
the input side of the amplifier without
feedback then what we'll have to do will

104
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,990
have to short this shunt connection that
means we have to short the output

105
00:10:50,990 --> 00:11:01,880
voltage so its result is short output
voltage this is only for the case of

106
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,649
voltage sampling now to have the output
side right to have the output side what

107
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:16,730
I will do I don't want this feedback at
the input side right so I want to

108
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:21,290
eliminate that if it is series
connection then I can say that if I open

109
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:26,660
that particular circuit between your
series direction of feedback and your

110
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,779
mixer then I can say that it will be
very sufficient to have this circuit

111
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:41,280
without feedback if I open it right so I
will do the open circuit

112
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,320
at input right this is only example if I
am saying

113
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:57,930
voltage series right so open it I will
say let's short it connected to the

114
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:04,860
O/P  okay so if I short it then I will
get at the input side okay so output

115
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,040
change current change the input negative current 
input change current output

116
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,740
for all topology we

117
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,320
will write that complete thing in your
topic tabulated form right this complete

118
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,320
thing we will write in a tabulated form
such as let's say that feedback topology

119
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,980
number one number two number three and
number four right I will write in short

120
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:45,690
that is voltage series voltage shunt for SH
right current series and current shunt

121
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:53,340
okay first of all you like that which is
sampling and which is mixing okay so

122
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,740
this is what it sampling
this is also voltage sampling

123
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,120
this is current sampling
and this is current sampling moreover

124
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,460
i will write if it is voltage sampling 
that I have to write it as shunt

125
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,930
connection
this is shunt connection this is series

126
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:22,610
connection and this is series connection
okay simple now what we'll have to learn

127
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,740
that what change I have to make at the
input side and what change I have to

128
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:36,589
make it at the output side so we will
write this as for input for input side

129
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:42,830
we have to change the output side right
so output we will do whenever it is

130
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:53,550
shunt I will say that output voltage
short-circuited right here also output

131
00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:04,530
is short-circuited here is a open
circuit at output because it is in

132
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:10,770
series if I don't want the feedback then
we can say that if I open one of these

133
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,360
series connection if I open that
circuit then I will disconnect the

134
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,090
feedback circuit related to your
amplifier circuit without feedback so

135
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:31,050
here also I will say it is open circuit
and output right similarly what we will do

136
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,300
at these output side as this is the
series connection I will write this

137
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:42,840
first as series connection this is the
shunt connection this is the series

138
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:51,210
connection and this is a shunt
connection then I can say that

139
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,420
this is voltage series this is voltage
shunt

140
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,810
this is current series and this is current shunt
okay very nice so wherever you look as

141
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:09,420
series we have to open it right so what
change I have to make this is changed

142
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:15,990
for output side of these without
feedback circuit this is nothing but if

143
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,690
it is series I will say that output you
don't have to change the output rather we are

144
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,740
then we have to change the input side so
open circuit

145
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:34,010
at input right similarly for the shunt
we have to short circuit at the short

146
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:43,940
circuit at input similarly as it is a
series I mean write it as open circuit at

147
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:53,400
input and here it will be short circuit
at input right we will take a few example

148
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,250
a very simple example that we will be
taking as example

149
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,420
this is the circuit

150
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,560
this is the input signal that I am
getting

151
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:18,380
we will take
okay simple and now we will say that

152
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:27,310
here it is your feedback
okay this is your RF this is an Re1 this

153
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:34,269
is our Re2- this is our Rc2 and this is
our Rc1 right no matter what is your DC

154
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:38,829
voltage here we are considering you are doing
AC analysis right

155
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:43,569
so with this is feedback circuit
this is given circuit right this is

156
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:49,510
given circuit with feedback
now we have to draw without feedback

157
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:58,300
right so we will draw without feedback
circuit without feedback

158
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:04,540
is okay without Feedback what will they do
first of all we have to identify the

159
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:11,020
topology as this is your output voltage
that is being given and this is your

160
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,929
input voltage I am saying that output
feedback is taken from the output node

161
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:23,309
right so it is nothing but your voltage
sampling right here I can say that as

162
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:31,710
feedback taken from
output node

163
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,240
right it is nothing but your voltage
sampling

164
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:43,840
simple and now your feedback is taken at
directly at the base so I can say that

165
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,070
here it is your
shunned mixing

166
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,150
okay this is shunt mixing, voltage sampling 
so your feedback topology is

167
00:17:53,150 --> 00:18:00,910
voltage shunt with negative feedback so
this topology is voltage shunt

168
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,620
okay now we will you say that for
voltage shunt what we'll have to do for

169
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,690
the input side and output side so for
voltage shunt if you want to develop

170
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,640
this particular input side then what
we'll have to do we'll have to open the

171
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,900
we'll have to do the output as short
circuit right so as this is the voltage

172
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,260
and you say that your output should get
short-circuited if i short circuit this

173
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,990
output this  Rf at the input side will
be down there right so I can say that

174
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:45,130
at the input side  what we will do this is
your Vs right

175
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:53,850
yeah
and I can say this is your Rfo

176
00:18:53,850 --> 00:19:00,560
hey this will be your Rf and I can say
that now this is nothing but the change

177
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,970
at the input side so change that input
okay

178
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,380
the rest all the things we have to get
as it is as far as this particular input

179
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,300
side is considered now we will not
change the rest part we will keep this

180
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:23,610
part as it is this will be our Re only
this is your Rc1 and this is attached to

181
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,920
your
further I want to develop your output

182
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,050
back so that's why I have kept it as it
is. So do the important Rc1 and

183
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,330
this Re1 okay
now what we'll have to do it is the

184
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,620
voltage shunt the negative feedback so
what we'll have to do we all have to do

185
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,789
the same thing that is nothing but
fixed a voltage shunt  negative

186
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:53,590
feedback so we can say that short
circuit at the input side as well so

187
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,269
what we can do we will do the short
circuit at the input side will consider

188
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,909
this Vs is equal to zero so if we keep
this Vs is equal to zero then I can say

189
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:11,499
that this Rf will be grounded right so
if this Rf is grounded so I can say this

190
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:16,259
will be in parallel with your Rc2

191
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:23,759
as well as AC analysis is considered
okay so this is also and this is also Rf

192
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,369
both  Rf we have to keep in our
circuit right so I can say that this is

193
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:37,830
nothing but your change at the output so
far whatever we have got it is nothing

194
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:46,889
but the feedback resistance Rf is placed
at the input side as well as output side

195
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:53,159
nearly same as that of your Millers
capacitor is Miller's effect okay but we

196
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,509
are not jumping into this Miller effect
but you have to concentrate that

197
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:03,629
particular theory for developing here
the input side and output side for

198
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:07,320
without feedbacks of it once we get this
without feedback circuits will move

199
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:17,440
again for this step number three
fine B find A and find Ri and find

200
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,510
Ro that is nothing but the required
parameter right once we get these this

201
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,730
is nothing but gain without feedback
this A gain without feedback he is a

202
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,410
feedback factor that will be different for
different topology you have to keep this

203
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:39,040
in mind Ri and Ro once you get that
Ri and Ro we will have to calculate

204
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:46,660
the value of Rif and  Rof and AF as well
so I will write this here all this and

205
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:54,220
always Af equal to A divided by 1 plus AB right
so calculate B calculate A once you

206
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,360
calculate both these values we will
easily get the value of Af right then

207
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:07,360
what we will have to calculate Ri
will be related with Ri multiplied by

208
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,890
1 plus AB or  Ri divided by this is
Rif it's a feedback with feedback

209
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:26,290
1 plus so this is depends on depending
on type of topology the same case for Ro

210
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:31,060
will not repeat it again Rof will have
to again calculate with the same way

211
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:38,200
right so in short once you get the value
of AB Ri and Ro we can easily

212
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,870
calculate all the values of the
parameter required for the negative

213
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,130
feedback amplifier obviously with
feedbacks so we will summarize this

214
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,930
complete video with three steps to solve
the numerical space from the negative

215
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,070
feedback amplifier first step is to
identify the negative feedback topology

216
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,100
based on the sampling and based on
mixing right next step is to draw the

217
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,870
complete circuit without feedback to
develop input side what change we have

218
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,740
to make at the output side to develop at
the output side what change you have to

219
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,150
make at the input side so depending on
that we can develop the circuit without

220
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,860
feedback and the third step is to
calculate all the mathematical

221
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:27,240
calculation is B,A,Ri Ro and etc depending on

222
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,680
the application depending on the
numerical which comes for you right so

223
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,260
we will stop this particular with this
particular findings we will stop here

224
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,500
next video we will learn few new
numerical which has been used for the Mumbai university
