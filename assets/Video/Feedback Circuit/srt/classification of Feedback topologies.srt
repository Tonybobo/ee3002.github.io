00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:13,160
Hello guys here. We will learn the next step
of the feedback amplifier videos that is nothing

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,119
but feedback topologies and the feedback typologies
We should know that how

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,450
many feedback amplifiers we have. We have
learned the voltage current transconductance

4
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:29,180
transresistance amplifier and based on that.
We will learn how many feedback topology is.

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:42,961
We have and on which basis we will classify
these feedback topologies. As far as this

6
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:49,329
topologies  are concerned. This topologies
are based on two factors how I am sampling

7
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:55,630
that particular output voltage with which
parameter and how am mixing that particular

8
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,930
voltage or current with particular parameter
with your input parameter, right? So depending

9
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:08,719
on that I will classify these typologies.
So before declassification, we should most

10
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,000
we should know that what is Sampling and what
is mixing? Okay, so we'll learn first. What

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:29,040
is sampling and what is mixing? So sampling
is nothing but let us understand the fact

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:38,810
that here we will say. This is your forward
block A okay, which is nothing but having

13
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:45,530
gained A and here I am saying it's having
two part one is ground and one with respect

14
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,461
to particular voltage or current right and
I can say that here it is your feedback. This

15
00:01:52,461 --> 00:02:03,200
is B okay what I'm saying that This particular
node a is joint with this particular node

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:12,450
B and this whatever rest node, which is attached
to this right then. Can you imagine can you

17
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,360
tell me that which part which parameter of
the output voltage is sampled? Whether it

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,120
is of current whether it is a voltage, right?
We have only two parameters to sample right

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,400
one is voltage and one is current now here
we can easily say that. If this is A and this

20
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,650
is B, right, what is the voltage between voltage
at the output side for forward block right

21
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,180
voltage at the output for the forward block
is nothing but VA minus VB, right? So VA

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,570
minus VB is nothing but the output voltage
which is at the forward amplifier right now.

23
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,680
I can say that whether current is given as
the sampled or voltage is given as a

24
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,459
sample parameter right current is flowing
through this particular part, right which

25
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,450
is given here right now current is also flowing
through this particular part, which is given

26
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,400
over here, right? But here I can say that
the value of the current will be different

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,349
because your load resistance is attached over
here. This is your RL, right? I can say

28
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:25,900
what if whatever voltage which is been given
at the input side is also same as that of

29
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,940
the output voltage of the forward block amplifier,
right? I can say this is nothing but the voltage

30
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:42,840
sampling. Okay, so I can say this is called
as the sampling. This is basically the sampling

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:52,150
Now we will learn what how I will get the
voltage sampling and how I will get the current

32
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:12,010
sampling. Okay. So sampling sampling is nothing,
but the part of output feed to input of

33
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:24,240
feedback circuit That is called as sampling
so we have two sampling part one is voltage

34
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:36,129
sampling. And another is current sampling.
Okay, so we will learn quickly. How will get

35
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:40,449
the voltage sampling and how will get the
current sampling? Okay.So first of all, I

36
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:50,009
will draw this circuit where I will get the
voltage sampling. This is A this is B part,

37
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:58,449
which is nothing but the feedback this is
forward block and I can say this complete.

38
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:07,689
Voltage at the output side is nothing but
the input side of your feedback block.Okay

39
00:05:07,689 --> 00:05:15,440
here I can say that this is nothing but your
output voltage Vo and this is also the output

40
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,819
voltage Vo so I can say that voltage is fed
back to your feedback circuit, and that's

41
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:34,249
why it is called as voltage sampling. So the
sampling part is voltage sampling now, how

42
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:39,619
will I get the different part which is nothing
but your current sampling how the circuit

43
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:51,879
will change at the output side. So we'll say
that. Let's draw the circuit again. Now I

44
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:59,000
can say that whatever current which is been
given right that is forwarded to your output

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,999
part. Right so I can say that this is how
the series combination will give you the current

46
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:12,830
sampling. So here I can say this is nothing
but the current Io and that is nothing but

47
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:22,389
the current Io. So obviously naming part
is as usual A and B. forward and feedback block

48
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:30,310
and I can say that this is achieved as current
sampling. Well giving all the number current

49
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,159
for each and every feedback topologies This
part is very very important whenever I am

50
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:43,710
using this shunting Network. So we'll say
that shunt circuit. Okay, this is shunt circuit

51
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,939
and this is the nothing but the series if
you can see here from the output side

52
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:53,529
of the forward block and input side of the
feedback block is connected in series so I

53
00:06:53,529 --> 00:07:01,999
can say this is nothing but the series circuit.
Okay. So keep this words in your mind while

54
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:07,979
defining particular topologies name. So as
far as sampling is concerned sampling is done

55
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,729
at the output side of the negative feedback
amplifier.Now we will learn what is the another

56
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:25,189
part that is called as mixing Okay, so We
will say that what is mixing mixing is nothing

57
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:50,110
but the addition. or subtraction of feedback
signal with source signal is called as mixing.

58
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:58,699
Okay, that is also been different thing. You
say that this is a mixer. Okay, and here I

59
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:09,360
can say that. Things are added. This is your
A and this is B okay. This can be your

60
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,300
current. This can be your voltage. Okay, I
have to identify that when it will be current

61
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,090
sample. Even it will be current to be mixing 
when it will be voltage mixing. Okay, so we

62
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:26,520
will see how it will be having the current
mixing and how it will be having the voltage

63
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,390
mixing. Usually it is called as series mixing
or shunt mixing but all together we are adding

64
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:37,529
some parameter and depending on the addition
of that particular parameter. We will say

65
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:45,910
that it is a series mixing or shunt mixing.
So here we will generalized in the form of

66
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,029
mixing. So keep this in mind that mixing is
been done in the negative feedback at the

67
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:59,810
input side of the negative 
feedback amplifier. So we will learn how we

68
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,209
will be getting the voltage mixing was  similarly with
current mixing we will learn that later

69
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:14,550
on. So how will I add the voltages? So if
this is the complete Source voltage okay with

70
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:23,170
respect to ground and I'm saying this is your
input voltage. This is your input voltage.

71
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:38,959
This is your Source voltage and this is your
Feedback voltage. So this is input voltage.

72
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,649
This is your feedback voltage and this is
your Source voltage. Can I identify that?

73
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:51,360
What is the relation between VI , VF and Vs.
Yes easily. I can say that Vs is nothing

74
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,100
but the addition of VI and VF okay, I can
say that this is Possible only if voltage

75
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,490
addition Is Possible only if the two circuits
are in series right? So if They're in series

76
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,180
connection then and only then it is possible
to have the addition of the two voltage becomes

77
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,670
your value of Vs is equal to VI plus VF.
Okay, so that's why we can name this mixing

78
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:25,290
part as your series mixing. So we have done
with the mixing voltage mixing part and it

79
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,490
is also called as series mixing. Okay, so
we will learn the another part as current

80
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:42,240
mixing how current will get mixed at the input
side. Okay, so we'll draw the particular diagram

81
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:54,709
for that. Now here I can say that. This is
the current I-s right. And at this node, this

82
00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:02,070
current is getting divided into two parts
one is current I-i and one is current I-f Okay,

83
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:08,240
we'll decide that direction later on but keep
this in mind that at this particular load

84
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,209
I-s is getting divided into two part I-i and
I-f right by using KCl and this is Possible

85
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:20,949
only if I Can use the shunt configuration.
So that's why this current mixing is also

86
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:32,329
called as shunt mixing. So whenever I am using
this current of your feedback voltage of feedback

87
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:38,550
output signal current is in the form of current
and that current is getting added with your

88
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:46,010
Source current. Then I can say that it forms
your shunt mixing, right? So as far as the mixing

89
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:53,290
and sampling part is considered we have learned
for configuration one is current sampling

90
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:59,740
voltage. Current mixing and voltage mixing
as far as voltage sampling is concerned. It

91
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,410
is also called as shunt circuit as far as
current sampling is also called as it is also

92
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,759
called as a series sampling,but when I'm dealing
with the mixing part, it is been done at the

93
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:15,269
input side of the negative feedback amplifier.
So voltage mixing is also called as a series

94
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:21,060
mixing and your current mixing is also called
as a shunt mixing so there will be two names

95
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,010
whether it is of the sampling mixing type
or mixing sampling types. So we learn

96
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:32,230
that topologies now now here we will go for
the particular types of topologies. So let's

97
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:50,470
discuss the particular types of topologies.
First topology, we will learn what will happen

98
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:58,839
if I'm using the circuit which will give you
voltage sampling and series mixing. Okay,

99
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:13,579
so that is called as voltage series. negative
feedback amplifier It's a long name voltage

100
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:20,899
series negative feedback amplifier. So it
is also have some different name. I'm saying

101
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:28,120
that this all naming is been done by using
sampling mixing type that means at the output

102
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:38,670
side to input side. So I'm saying that this
is using sampling mixing type I will use

103
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:45,149
all the names by using sampling and mixing
type. Okay now tell me how will I use another

104
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:54,120
name if I'm using current sampling and series
mixing. Okay, so that will be your current.

105
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:05,600
Series negative feedback amplifier.I'm using
the same notation sampling and mixing. So

106
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,709
the name itself will tell you that what is
the sampling sampling parameter is current

107
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:20,470
and how the parameter is added. It is in series
combination, right? So third one will be voltage

108
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:27,100
shunt parameter where you are sampling parameter
is voltage and the mixing is been done by

109
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:41,300
using shunt circuits so voltage shunt negative
feedback amplifier Okay, now forth you can

110
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:58,230
also note that it's nothing but current shunt.
Simple now we'll have to learn how I can name

111
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,910
this with different name cleaning configuration.
So we will say that this is done by sampling

112
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:13,720
and mixing right we will learn different notation
by using mixing and sampling mixing and sampling.

113
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,949
Okay keep this in mind that here we don't
have to use the parameter as voltage and current

114
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:26,329
we just use this circuit configuration right
as series or Shunt right. So whenever I'm

115
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:33,480
using mixing and sampling then I have to say
that mixing is if it is mixing it is done

116
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,540
by voltage parameter then obviously that voltage
mixing is a series combination, right? So

117
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:48,290
voltage mixing is series combination ticket.
So that's why this will be your series will

118
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:54,389
come first here.It is sampling and mixing
right if I'm using mixing sampling for the

119
00:15:54,389 --> 00:16:04,019
naming then I will use the series. Okay, sampling
is of the type voltage and voltage sampling

120
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:11,329
is nothing but with the circuit as shunt configuration,
so this is nothing but the configuration as

121
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:17,600
series shunt configuration. So my another
name is nothing but series shunt configuration,

122
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:25,740
right? So likewise. I can also form a different
name based on mixing sampling part for further

123
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:34,050
topologies, right? So for this particular
topologies I can say it is nothing but a series

124
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:43,759
series Negative feedback amplifier.Okay similarly
over here. I will write this as shunt series

125
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:53,629
negative feedback amplifier, right? So as
far as this voltage this is shunt mixing and

126
00:16:53,629 --> 00:17:02,290
as far as sampling is done. Mixing is
of the type of shunt and series is it in

127
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,530
the form of voltage with a sampling Okay
here for voltage sampling you're using shunt

128
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,679
circuit.That's why your shunt name will come
into picture for this particular configuration.

129
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:20,939
And here we will write it as shunt series 
because sampling is done with the current

130
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,780
with series circuit. So now another name is  current for this voltage is negative feedback

131
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,580
current series negative feedback voltage series 
negative feedback current series negative

132
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,220
feedback as different form with mixing and
sampling configuration. Now here we will have

133
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:44,190
to learn the separately the analysis of all
the topologies voltage series current series

134
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,419
current shunt voltage shunt and all the topologies
