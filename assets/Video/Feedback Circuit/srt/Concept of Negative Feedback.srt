00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:10,980
Hello friends here, we will start with the
new chapter all together and the concept is

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:25,800
feedback amplifier. Okay, as for amplifier
is concerned we know that the amplifier is

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,540
nothing but if I'm providing small input,
then I'm increasing the strength of the input

4
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,930
at the output side of an amplifier box. Right?
So as far as amplifier box is concerned that

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:47,640
is not black box for me. Okay. So let's understand
the fact that amplifier. This is the box of

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,710
amplifier Let It Be whether it is of cscs
multistage amplifier single stage amplifier

7
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:58,609
three stage amplifier doesn't matters for
me. So this is your input signal that input

8
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:05,009
signal may be in the form of current 
or voltage trigger. So I'm saying that this

9
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:12,590
is Ii and this is Vi input current or input
voltage here. We will be getting the output

10
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,830
voltage. Our output current right and here
whatever circuit is giving that is nothing

11
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,220
but the gain of an amplifier and that is represented
with the letter A as far as this particular

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,240
box is concerned that is not new to me. Right
and now we have to learn that what is feedback

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,220
and what how it affects your amplifier operation
and why we need that feedback amplifier. So

14
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:55,259
let us consider the feedback invention is
done in1928 right so invention of feedback

15
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:08,800
Is done by Harold Black? And in the year of
1928 that is not important first important

16
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,329
part as far as exam point of view. This is
just you have to remember for extra knowledge,

17
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:20,610
right and then we will learn what is exactly
feedback and now how it affects the amplifier

18
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:30,410
operation.Let's start with this fact that
this is let's say feedback amplifier

19
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,950
The Heading of concept of feedback amplifier.
So before learning the feedback, you should

20
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,970
know that whether we have some part of system.
Let's say for example, I'm considering one

21
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,880
particular bag box. Just now. We have studied
that I'm giving the input and I'm getting

22
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,669
the output. That's it. I'm not giving I'm
not utilizing that particular output to give

23
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:57,670
that particular same signal at the input side
to check that whether output is really the

24
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:05,530
Part of input or not, right? So that is carried
out by using feedback. So that feedback is

25
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,040
of two types. Okay, so we'll draw that particular
feedback block diagram and then we'll get

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:28,549
to know that how that feedback is important
as far as amplifier is concerned. Here you

27
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:38,790
have two diagrams in front of you this simple
box that we already have learned that is nothing

28
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,580
but a simple amplifier, right that box is
nothing but simple amplifier where I'm giving

29
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,989
so let's suppose I'm having input voltage
and i am having at the output side output voltage

30
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:56,600
and this is called as open loop configuration.
This is called as open loop configuration.

31
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:08,290
Whenever I'm using another block diagram where
this is same amplifier that is forward Amplified.

32
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:15,570
So in this particular box A is nothing but
the forward gain amplifier and whatever this

33
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:21,519
box is called as feedback amplifier. This
is called as a feedback circuit and let's

34
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,680
say I'm saying this as input signal let's
say I am saying that it's Vs right Source signal

35
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,520
and this is your output signal. Let's say
Vo, right, whatever output or output voltage

36
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,890
and feeding back to your input side to check
that whether the output is a part of input

37
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,510
signal or not whether there is a distortion
or not. So this is carried out by using the

38
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,750
feedback amplifier. So that is represented
by the letter B. Okay, so they can be output

39
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,900
voltage or output current they can be input
so input current or input voltage, right?

40
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,120
So there are different possibilities can be
carried out by using that we have different

41
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,360
topologies that we have to learn in the next
videos. So let us discuss let us concentrate

42
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,950
on this particular part. This is a closed
loop configuration. This is because whenever

43
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,590
I'm starting with vs and reaching towards
Vo and that Vo is again fed back to the input

44
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:34,460
side, right so that forms a loop. So that's
why this is called as Loop configuration.

45
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,600
Now important fact is this feedback amplifier
can be here I'm saying this is nothing but

46
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:49,110
your mixer. This is nothing but mixer where
an adding this Vs.That is Source signal to

47
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,150
your feedback signal or subtracting that source
signal with your feedback signal. So if I'm

48
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:03,310
subtracting the Vs with VF, this is VF and
saying right if I'm subtracting that VF with

49
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:22,120
Vs. Then I'm saying that it is called as negative
feedback, right? So that's why Okay, if I'm

50
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,240
saying that this VF is getting added with
Vs. Then I will say that it is nothing but

51
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,370
a positive feedback. So here itself we get
to know that there are two categories of feedback

52
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:48,811
one is negative feedback and one is positive
feedback. So here in this particular case,

53
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:55,900
whether it is negative or positive there can
be used in different applications. So whenever

54
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,980
I am using the negative feedback negative
feedback is basically used in amplifier. This

55
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:17,450
positive feedback is used in basically oscillators
or signal generators. So as far as this feedback

56
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,850
is concerned. So in your laboratory is there
are function generators the where we get the

57
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:27,639
sinusoidal signal so your triangular signals,
you are Sawtooth wave and M number of ways

58
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,350
we can get from the function generator and
this function generator is an example of positive

59
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,169
feedback, right that will learn the discussed
in detail in the next chapter itself in detail.

60
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:43,070
So as far as feedback is concerned we learned
that this is positive feedback when I'm getting

61
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,639
when I am adding the source. With your feedback
signal and saying it is negative feedback

62
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,430
If I'm saying Vs is getting subtracted with
VF. Right and whatever signal I'm getting

63
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,900
over here that is called as error signal,
right? So if Vs is not actually equal or equal

64
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,460
to or scaled with Vo then I can say that the
error signal will get generated and depending

65
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,580
on error signal. I will Design my amplifier
such that to get the proper, correct. Output

66
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,540
at the output side. So that is the basic aim
of the feedback amplifiers. Now, we will learn

67
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,980
the mathematical point of view of the negative
feedback and positive feedback as well generalized

68
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,479
form. Let's understand that I'm taking this
example of taking input as voltage and output

69
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,370
as voltage only so it forms an voltage amplifier
where we'll be getting the gain in the form

70
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,870
of ratio of output voltage to the input voltage.
So let us discuss that I know that for open

71
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,340
loop configuration for open lop Configuration
means I'm not providing any feedback. So if

72
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:55,010
I'm not providing any feedback, what will
be the gain of my complete circuit as an amplifier?

73
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,970
So for open loop configuration this B will
not come into picture then in that case. I

74
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,960
can say that Vi is same as  Vs.
And I can say that Vo divided by Vs is equal

75
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,120
to Vo/ VI
is equal to voltage gain, and that is nothing

76
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:19,400
but A right so I will say that voltage gain.
I will treat this as with a letter A A is

77
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:28,839
nothing but Vo upon VI is equal to vo upon
Vs. I will treat that equation number one.

78
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:36,570
Okay now hold on for closed loop configuration
that means with feedback for closed loop configuration.

79
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:51,870
For closed loop configuration i am writing
in bracket with feedback. If I'm providing

80
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:58,260
feedback, then then we'll have to do some
mathematical operation. In this case see to

81
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,680
it that I am learning the negative feedback
in that case. This is the should be negative.

82
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:20,890
Right this is positive. So whatever VI and
getting that is in the form of VS + VF VS minus VF right. So first equation,
I will be getting in the form of  Vs VF and

83
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:28,810
VI, right? So I will write it over here the
voltage gain that I will be getting that.

84
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:37,110
I will treat it as AF voltage gain that I
will treat it as AF and that is equal to

85
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:47,590
Vo divided by Vs. Let's treat it as equation
number 2. So let's start with the mathematical

86
00:10:47,590 --> 00:11:01,450
operation, right? So from block diagram. as far as block diagram is concerned. I know

87
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:09,210
that whatever Vo-Vi ratio is nothing but A
whatever Vo-VF ratio is nothing but B so

88
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:19,640
I can say that A is equal to Vo divided by
Vi. Okay treat it as equation number 3 I know

89
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,240
that B is equal to VF that is nothing but
the output for B and Vo is nothing but the

90
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:32,260
input for B so VF / Vo is nothing but B.
so we'll treat it as VF / Vo equation number

91
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,890
4 again one mathematical expression will get
from this particular mixer is nothing but

92
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:51,050
Vs Minus VF is equal to VI. Now what we have
to do we will put the value of VF and Vi

93
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:58,490
this is because I want to Vs in your voltage
gain formula, right? I don't want VF

94
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:05,330
and VI, but I can find out. What is VF in the
form of Vo and B. I can find out. What is

95
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:10,950
the value of Vi in the form of Vo and A again
so that I will get complete. Expression in

96
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:20,959
the form of Vo and Vs only right? So we'll
treat this as from equation three and four,

97
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:40,580
we will be getting Vs. I will keep it as it
is - what is Vf Vf is nothing but B into Vo okay simple what is Vi Vi is nothing but
Vo divided by A so here it will be Vo / A

98
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:45,870
right just do the your mathematical manipulation
here and there left to right right to left

99
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:52,480
keep Vo at Vo by Vs at the left hand side
and as part of the right hand side, so I will

100
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:04,709
be getting Vo divided by Vs that is equal
to A  divided by 1 plus AB So as far as this

101
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:12,089
is this is nothing but you are AF okay. So
this is your last mathematical expression

102
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:19,320
that we are expecting for your negative feedback
operation for gain perspective. I can conclude

103
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,850
that from this particular operation 
from this particular mathematical expression

104
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:30,399
I can conclude that whatever negative feedback.
I'm providing that will result in the reduction

105
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:55,120
of gain Okay, so

106
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,000
Here the statement is negative feedback leads
to reduce the gain of an amplifier. So so

107
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,769
far what we have whatever we have discussed
is about the feedback amplifier, but one question

108
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:22,810
is remained in our mind that why we are using
that negative feedback amplifier by we are

109
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:42,040
using the feedback if the voltage gain 
is reduced right
