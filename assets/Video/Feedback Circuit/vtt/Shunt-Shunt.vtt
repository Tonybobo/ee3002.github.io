00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.710
here we see a feedback circuit so the
first step is to identify the input and

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.680
the output it's seen here that the input
is a current source and the output is a

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:27.840
voltage source so this is going to be a
shunt shunt type network after

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.170
identifying the type of feedback the
next step is to identify the feedback

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.790
portion of the network
here we see from the output to the input

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.210
side here's the output side here is an
input side that we have our Rf is our

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.090
feedback portion so to find the next
step which is our R11 and R22 and beta

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.629
we're going to look at the feedback
portion only to look at R11 we have to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.630
look at this side of the network which
is going to be a shunt so we're going to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:18.630
ground that side and R11 is going to
be our Rf for R22 again we draw the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.130
feedback portion and we look at this
side of it and then we refer back to the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.450
type and it's a shunt so again we short
shunt and we open a series we leave it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:45.869
open so this is again going to be our RF
for R22 now for beta we draw the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:52.020
network again and for beta on the output
side we put the type of output it is in

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.130
this case it's Vo so we place Vo on this side it's a current so we

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:09.179
place a short for the current and we
call this I-f  beta is defined as I-f

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.619
over Vo

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.000
so putting I-f  in terms of Vo
it's going in this direction so it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:31.370
negative so we have I-f is equal to a
negative Vo over Rf so to get this

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.840
in terms of I-f over Vo we'll
divide here and this ends up being a

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:47.020
minus 1 over Rf as the value for the
feedback so now that we have those three

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.450
components we can redraw the small
signal version of this removing the

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.200
feedback portion and placing in now this
R11 at the input side R22 at the

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.720
output side and then we use the
equations for this beta which is beta

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.980
feed back so I'm going to call it beta
feed here and redrawing this with the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.910
small signal circuit

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:32.430
I'm going to short this capacitor which
is large for this is my input side so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.130
I'm going to place our R11 here

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.540
the source site is grounded so remember
this is gate source and drain and I'm

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.600
going to also include ro and then this
is an ideal current source so that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.880
becomes an open and this is my output
side so I put R22 here and

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:18.150
this is my Vo so from this this is
my new A circuit I want to gather three

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.989
pieces of information I want to know the
gain which is going to be Vo over

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:30.090
I -s which will be my A value the
open-loop gain value A I want to know Ri

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:40.500
which will include Rs and I want to know
ro which will include RL in this case

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:52.590
there is no RL so my ro will be at this
location and my Ri will be here and then

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:02.970
the A gain will be from Vo to I-s so
now I want to analyze this circuit so I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.200
need to get Vo in terms of I-s so Vo can be written as a minus the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.490
current minus g-m vgs times these two in
parallel so ro and parallel with R22

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.380
which is Rf so I'm going to just put
those values as Rf and here is also Rf

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:35.820
now Vgs is a current source in so I
times R will give me the G and I notice

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.480
that Vs is ground so Vgs will be just
VG remember that if it's not you also

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:50.610
have to find the Vs value and get Vgs
which is VG minus Vs so Vgs in this

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.800
case then was I-s times Rs and parallel
with Rf

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.800
and I can plug that in here and then
divide by I-s to get Vo over I-s

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:16.420
which is my A as A minus g-m ro in
parallel with Rf x Rs in parallel with

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:30.040
Rf so now I have my A value i can also
write Ri and Rf ro so Ri

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:39.040
remember this includes Rs will be Rs
in parallel with Rf and ro which is here

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:49.570
is on the top of the dependent source so
it's gonna be ro in parallel with Rf so

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:56.230
now I have these three values I'm going
to use the feedback equations with the

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:03.850
amount of feedback for Ro and Ri
the amount of feedback whether I divide

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.040
or multiply depends on the type of
network I have for shunt type we're

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.530
gonna always divide by 1 over or 1 over
the amount of feedback and for series

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.360
it's always a multiplication so since
both of these are shunt on both sides

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.820
the input side is shunt the output side
is a shunt they're both going to be

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:40.740
divided by the amount of feedback so AF
is going to be A over 1 plus a beta feed

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:52.030
just the feedback value minus 1 over RC
so I get A is a minus g-m ro in parallel

00:07:52.030 --> 00:08:03.160
with Rf Rs in parallel with Rf
all over 1 plus again this minus a or a

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.919
which is a minus GM ro and parallel
with Rf Rs and parallel

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:16.030
with RF x the beta feedback which is a
minus 1 over RF so these minuses cancel

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:25.199
and give me a positive term so this is
my AF value and this is the feedback

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:41.399
gain that we'll have for this particular
circuit now for Ri Rif this includes Rs

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:50.680
I'm going to divide the Rs in parallel
with Rf which is my Ri value by the

00:08:50.680 --> 00:09:01.600
bottom of this which is the amount of
feedback now this includes the RS I do

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:08.890
not want to include the RS for my
overall feedback value so because this

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:18.300
is a shunt type to remove the RS the
term we used was Rin this does not

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:30.420
include RS we have to take this Rif and
it's usually easier to find the value

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:37.269
itself and subtract off the Rs because
it's in shunt that means it's in

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:44.860
parallel so I'm going to have to take
this as a parallel form for Ri or

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:55.199
Rof it's the same thing
it was ro in parallel with RF divided by

00:09:55.199 --> 00:10:02.170
the 1 plus a beta feed and so that's
again the same term GM ro in parallel

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:12.250
with Rf Rs in parallel with Rf times
1 over Rf since there's no load RL that

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:20.319
we factored in there this would be also
Rout for this case if we had an RL

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:25.030
included in this
to remove it we again would use one over

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:33.330
rof minus 1 over RL to remove it
