00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.980
Hello friends here, we will start with the
new chapter all together and the concept is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:25.800
feedback amplifier. Okay, as for amplifier
is concerned we know that the amplifier is

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.540
nothing but if I'm providing small input,
then I'm increasing the strength of the input

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.930
at the output side of an amplifier box. Right?
So as far as amplifier box is concerned that

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:47.640
is not black box for me. Okay. So let's understand
the fact that amplifier. This is the box of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.710
amplifier Let It Be whether it is of cscs
multistage amplifier single stage amplifier

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.609
three stage amplifier doesn't matters for
me. So this is your input signal that input

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.009
signal may be in the form of current
or voltage trigger. So I'm saying that this

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:12.590
is Ii and this is Vi input current or input
voltage here. We will be getting the output

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.830
voltage. Our output current right and here
whatever circuit is giving that is nothing

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.220
but the gain of an amplifier and that is represented
with the letter A as far as this particular

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.240
box is concerned that is not new to me. Right
and now we have to learn that what is feedback

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.220
and what how it affects your amplifier operation
and why we need that feedback amplifier. So

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:55.259
let us consider the feedback invention is
done in1928 right so invention of feedback

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:08.800
Is done by Harold Black? And in the year of
1928 that is not important first important

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.329
part as far as exam point of view. This is
just you have to remember for extra knowledge,

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:20.610
right and then we will learn what is exactly
feedback and now how it affects the amplifier

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.410
operation.Let's start with this fact that
this is let's say feedback amplifier

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.950
The Heading of concept of feedback amplifier.
So before learning the feedback, you should

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.970
know that whether we have some part of system.
Let's say for example, I'm considering one

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.880
particular bag box. Just now. We have studied
that I'm giving the input and I'm getting

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.669
the output. That's it. I'm not giving I'm
not utilizing that particular output to give

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:57.670
that particular same signal at the input side
to check that whether output is really the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.530
Part of input or not, right? So that is carried
out by using feedback. So that feedback is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.040
of two types. Okay, so we'll draw that particular
feedback block diagram and then we'll get

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:28.549
to know that how that feedback is important
as far as amplifier is concerned. Here you

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:38.790
have two diagrams in front of you this simple
box that we already have learned that is nothing

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.580
but a simple amplifier, right that box is
nothing but simple amplifier where I'm giving

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.989
so let's suppose I'm having input voltage
and i am having at the output side output voltage

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:56.600
and this is called as open loop configuration.
This is called as open loop configuration.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:08.290
Whenever I'm using another block diagram where
this is same amplifier that is forward Amplified.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.570
So in this particular box A is nothing but
the forward gain amplifier and whatever this

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.519
box is called as feedback amplifier. This
is called as a feedback circuit and let's

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.680
say I'm saying this as input signal let's
say I am saying that it's Vs right Source signal

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.520
and this is your output signal. Let's say
Vo, right, whatever output or output voltage

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.890
and feeding back to your input side to check
that whether the output is a part of input

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.510
signal or not whether there is a distortion
or not. So this is carried out by using the

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.750
feedback amplifier. So that is represented
by the letter B. Okay, so they can be output

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.900
voltage or output current they can be input
so input current or input voltage, right?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.120
So there are different possibilities can be
carried out by using that we have different

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.360
topologies that we have to learn in the next
videos. So let us discuss let us concentrate

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.950
on this particular part. This is a closed
loop configuration. This is because whenever

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.590
I'm starting with vs and reaching towards
Vo and that Vo is again fed back to the input

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:34.460
side, right so that forms a loop. So that's
why this is called as Loop configuration.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.600
Now important fact is this feedback amplifier
can be here I'm saying this is nothing but

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:49.110
your mixer. This is nothing but mixer where
an adding this Vs.That is Source signal to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.150
your feedback signal or subtracting that source
signal with your feedback signal. So if I'm

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:03.310
subtracting the Vs with VF, this is VF and
saying right if I'm subtracting that VF with

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:22.120
Vs. Then I'm saying that it is called as negative
feedback, right? So that's why Okay, if I'm

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.240
saying that this VF is getting added with
Vs. Then I will say that it is nothing but

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.370
a positive feedback. So here itself we get
to know that there are two categories of feedback

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:48.811
one is negative feedback and one is positive
feedback. So here in this particular case,

00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:55.900
whether it is negative or positive there can
be used in different applications. So whenever

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.980
I am using the negative feedback negative
feedback is basically used in amplifier. This

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:17.450
positive feedback is used in basically oscillators
or signal generators. So as far as this feedback

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.850
is concerned. So in your laboratory is there
are function generators the where we get the

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.639
sinusoidal signal so your triangular signals,
you are Sawtooth wave and M number of ways

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:32.350
we can get from the function generator and
this function generator is an example of positive

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:38.169
feedback, right that will learn the discussed
in detail in the next chapter itself in detail.

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.070
So as far as feedback is concerned we learned
that this is positive feedback when I'm getting

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.639
when I am adding the source. With your feedback
signal and saying it is negative feedback

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:55.430
If I'm saying Vs is getting subtracted with
VF. Right and whatever signal I'm getting

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:02.900
over here that is called as error signal,
right? So if Vs is not actually equal or equal

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:09.460
to or scaled with Vo then I can say that the
error signal will get generated and depending

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:15.580
on error signal. I will Design my amplifier
such that to get the proper, correct. Output

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.540
at the output side. So that is the basic aim
of the feedback amplifiers. Now, we will learn

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.980
the mathematical point of view of the negative
feedback and positive feedback as well generalized

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:32.479
form. Let's understand that I'm taking this
example of taking input as voltage and output

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.370
as voltage only so it forms an voltage amplifier
where we'll be getting the gain in the form

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:43.870
of ratio of output voltage to the input voltage.
So let us discuss that I know that for open

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.340
loop configuration for open lop Configuration
means I'm not providing any feedback. So if

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:55.010
I'm not providing any feedback, what will
be the gain of my complete circuit as an amplifier?

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.970
So for open loop configuration this B will
not come into picture then in that case. I

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.960
can say that Vi is same as  Vs.
And I can say that Vo divided by Vs is equal

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.120
to Vo/ VI
is equal to voltage gain, and that is nothing

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:19.400
but A right so I will say that voltage gain.
I will treat this as with a letter A A is

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:28.839
nothing but Vo upon VI is equal to vo upon
Vs. I will treat that equation number one.

00:09:28.839 --> 00:09:36.570
Okay now hold on for closed loop configuration
that means with feedback for closed loop configuration.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:51.870
For closed loop configuration i am writing
in bracket with feedback. If I'm providing

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:58.260
feedback, then then we'll have to do some
mathematical operation. In this case see to

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:04.680
it that I am learning the negative feedback
in that case. This is the should be negative.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:20.890
Right this is positive. So whatever VI and
getting that is in the form of VS + VF VS minus VF right. So first equation,
I will be getting in the form of  Vs VF and

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:28.810
VI, right? So I will write it over here the
voltage gain that I will be getting that.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:37.110
I will treat it as AF voltage gain that I
will treat it as AF and that is equal to

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:47.590
Vo divided by Vs. Let's treat it as equation
number 2. So let's start with the mathematical

00:10:47.590 --> 00:11:01.450
operation, right? So from block diagram. as far as block diagram is concerned. I know

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:09.210
that whatever Vo-Vi ratio is nothing but A
whatever Vo-VF ratio is nothing but B so

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:19.640
I can say that A is equal to Vo divided by
Vi. Okay treat it as equation number 3 I know

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.240
that B is equal to VF that is nothing but
the output for B and Vo is nothing but the

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:32.260
input for B so VF / Vo is nothing but B.
so we'll treat it as VF / Vo equation number

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:37.890
4 again one mathematical expression will get
from this particular mixer is nothing but

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:51.050
Vs Minus VF is equal to VI. Now what we have
to do we will put the value of VF and Vi

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:58.490
this is because I want to Vs in your voltage
gain formula, right? I don't want VF

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:05.330
and VI, but I can find out. What is VF in the
form of Vo and B. I can find out. What is

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:10.950
the value of Vi in the form of Vo and A again
so that I will get complete. Expression in

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:20.959
the form of Vo and Vs only right? So we'll
treat this as from equation three and four,

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:40.580
we will be getting Vs. I will keep it as it
is - what is Vf Vf is nothing but B into Vo okay simple what is Vi Vi is nothing but
Vo divided by A so here it will be Vo / A

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:45.870
right just do the your mathematical manipulation
here and there left to right right to left

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:52.480
keep Vo at Vo by Vs at the left hand side
and as part of the right hand side, so I will

00:12:52.480 --> 00:13:04.709
be getting Vo divided by Vs that is equal
to A  divided by 1 plus AB So as far as this

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:12.089
is this is nothing but you are AF okay. So
this is your last mathematical expression

00:13:12.089 --> 00:13:19.320
that we are expecting for your negative feedback
operation for gain perspective. I can conclude

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.850
that from this particular operation
from this particular mathematical expression

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:30.399
I can conclude that whatever negative feedback.
I'm providing that will result in the reduction

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:55.120
of gain Okay, so

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.000
Here the statement is negative feedback leads
to reduce the gain of an amplifier. So so

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.769
far what we have whatever we have discussed
is about the feedback amplifier, but one question

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:22.810
is remained in our mind that why we are using
that negative feedback amplifier by we are

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:42.040
using the feedback if the voltage gain
is reduced right
