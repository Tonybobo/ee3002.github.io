00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.060
hello in this video we are going to take
a look at an example of series shunt

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.250
feedback in a voltage amplifier with a
practical example of an amplifier we are

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.830
familiar with which is the non-inverting
amplifier first of all I have redrawn

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.580
the basic structure the generic
structure for a series shunt or series

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.570
voltage amplifier which consists of a
feedback network the input voltage or

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.129
the feedback voltage is connected in
series with the input voltage with the

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:42.769
source voltage and the output is taken
in shunt the output signal is sampled

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.339
in shunt and so basically this could be
our output signal right here Vo

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:58.589
this could be our signal VF feedback
signal and then the input signal will

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:06.390
this be Vs minus VF as you can see just
from applying KVL to circuits and I'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.570
just gonna write it all out Vin equals Vs
minus VF alright and now let's move down

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.609
to our practical example which is the
non-inverting amplifier we can see this

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.869
is a non-inverting amplifier the input
is applied to the non-inverting input

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.039
terminal Vs and there is a feedback
network comprised of resistors RI and RF

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:40.619
I have connected in the feedback path
now our feedback network in this case is

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.960
going to be that voltage divider

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.500
over there and you can see that we are
sampling our output signal in shunt

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.340
perhaps represent that a bit
more clearly by writing it like this

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.990
my output signal is being taken between
the output notd and and ground so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.510
essentially when you're sampling it from
here to ground that this were the other

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.209
end of Ri is going to sampling it in
shunt or in parallel and then the input

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.930
signal you are applying it in series so
essentially we also represent this as

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.410
follows

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:41.709
to make it more clear this is Vs and you
can see that this is

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.900
the feedback voltage will be VF the
voltage appearing between the output

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.130
right there of the feedback network and
the other output which goes to ground so

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.280
VF and Vin will

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.360
equal to Vs minus VF again from applying
KVL so let's take a look at how the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:19.400
different parameters for a standard or
general feedback circuit apply here

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.230
first of all we have our feedback factor
beta

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.900
and in this case we can see that beta
is going to be the gain of the feedback

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.380
Network and essentially the ratio of VF
to Vout and we can see that in this

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.790
case is just a result of voltage
division between RF and RI and so VF is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.630
going to be equal to V out times RI over
RI plus RF

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.560
that is my feedback factor or the gain
of my feedback loop then I have my

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.890
loop gain a beta is basically going to
be that times again so A times RI

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.380
divided by RI plus RF

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:30.680
my closed-loop gain AF is going to
be equal to the ratio of the outs to vs

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.470
and we know from our previous study that
it's going to be the open-loop gain

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.480
divided by the amount of feedback

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.990
and now if my open loop gain is
sufficiently high I will achieve gain

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.950
desensitization what do I mean by that
will mean that my closed loop gain will

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.090
become almost independent of the open
loop gain and pretty much just dependent

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.810
on the feedback network and let's see
how that works for values of the loop

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:17.360
gain much greater than 1 then I can
approximate my expression for AF my

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.680
closed loop gain as being approximately
1 over beta which is

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.780
RI + RF divided by RI just from the beta
expression up there which is 1 plus RF

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.180
over RI which matches the closed-loop
gain that we know for a non-inverting

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.310
amplifier we have seen when we can see
that you know the term of the open-loop

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.780
gain has disappeared since we know a
little bit more now about negative

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.980
feedback systems we expect that we are
also going to gain other things not just

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.010
the gain being independent of the
open-loop gain but we're going to also

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.760
get improvements in both input and
output resistance with respect to the

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.890
open loop amplifier and so when I have
it connected in feedback I expect my

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.650
input resistance is going to be the
input resistance of the op-amp

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:16.480
multiplied times the amount of feedback
and my output resistance for the overall

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.580
system is going to be equal to the
output resistance of the op-amp divided

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.180
by the loop gain of the amount of
feedback sorry

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.230
and so this corroborates what we know
both about the non-inverting amplifier

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.290
but also puts a little bit more in
context all these new parameters that we

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.840
have a study in negative feedback thank
you
